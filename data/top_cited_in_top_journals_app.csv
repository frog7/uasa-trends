"Yang, J | Reichert, P | Abbaspour, KC | Xia, J | Yang, H",2008,Comparing uncertainty analysis techniques for a SWAT application to the Chaohe Basin in China,Applications_JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,316,31.6,"Distributed watershed models are increasingly being used to support decisions about alternative management strategies in the areas of land use change, climate change, water allocation, and pollution control. For this reason it is important that these models pass through a careful calibration and uncertainty analysis. To fulfil this demand, in recent years, scientists have come up with various uncertainty analysis techniques for watershed models. To determine the differences and similarities of these techniques we compared five uncertainty analysis procedures: Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE), Parameter Solution (ParaSol), Sequential Uncertainty Fitting algorithm (SUFI-), and a Bayesian framework implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Importance Sampling (IS) techniques. As these techniques are different in their philosophies and leave the user some freedom in formulating the generalized likelihood measure, objective function, or likelihood function, a literal comparison between these techniques is not possible. As there is a small spectrum of different applications in hydrology for the first three techniques, we made this choice according to their typical, use in hydrology. For Bayesian inference, we used a recently developed likelihood function that does not obviously violate the statistical assumptions, namely a continuous-time autoregressive error model. We implemented all these techniques for the soil and water assessment toot (SWAT) and applied them to the Chaohe Basin in China. We compared the results with respect to the posterior parameter distributions, performances of their best estimates, prediction uncertainty, conceptual bases, computational efficiency, and difficulty of implementation. The comparison results for these categories are listed and the advantages and disadvantages are analyzed. From the point of view of the authors, if computationally feasible, Bayesian-based approaches are most recommendable because of their solid conceptual basis, but construction and test of the likelihood function requires critical attention.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.05.012,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.05.012

Two such representations are considered, based on the orthogonal projection of uncertain data and solution variables using either a Haar or a Legendre basis. Governing equations for the unknown coefficients in the resulting representations are derived using a Galerkin procedure and then integrated in order to determine the behavior of the stochastic process. The schemes are applied to a model problem involving a simplified dynamical system and to the classical problem of Rayleigh-Benard instability. For situations involving random parameters close to a critical point, the computational implementations show that the Wiener-Haar (WHa) representation provides more robust predictions that those based on a Wiener-Legendre (WLe) decomposition.

The reliability and utility of the physically based Penman-Monteith approach to generate ETpot has been recently advocated. Assuming land-surface conditions, spatial surfaces of reference evapotranspiration (ETO) can be generated taking into account the topographic influence of forcing meteorological variables. This was performed in this paper by spatially interpolating maximum (T-max) and minimum (T-min) air temperatures, wind speed (u) and vapor pressure (ea), using a spline model with a linear sub-model dependency on elevation, and modelling the radiation environment, taking topography (i.e., elevation, slope and aspect) into account, prior to calculating ETO at each grid-cell. In accordance with previous research, resultant lapse rates showed a strong seasonal pattern; values were steeper in summer than winter and those for Tma, were steeper than for T-min. Monthly mean T-max lapse rates varied from -. degrees C km(-) in winter to -. degrees C km(-) in summer, with T-min lapse rates ranging from -. degrees C km(-) in winter, to -. degrees C km(-) in summer. Monthly climatotogies of the near-surface elevation-dependence (NSED) for u and ea also showed strong seasonal values. NSED of u varied from . ms(-) km(-) in winter reducing to . ms(-) km(-) in summer. The NSED for e(a) ranged from -. kPa km(-) in winter to -. kPa km(-) in summer. For a -month sequence from  through , spatial surfaces of ET with a  m resolution for the , km() study site located in the Loess Plateau, China were generated using an 'interpolate-then-catculate' approach. Resultant ET values varied from about  mm month(-) in winter to over  mm month(-) in summer. In order to assess the reliability of these ETO surfaces, pan evaporation (Ep,,,) was also spatially interpolated and from these a set of pan coefficient (K-pan - a unitless ratio defined as ET/E-pan) surfaces were calculated. Spatio-temporally averaged K-pan values for the study site varied from . in April to . in late summer. K-pan values were in agreement with another study using a Chinese  cm diameter micro-pan, and, as expected, were tower than other values documented using a Class A pan. The influence of topography, especially aspect, was seen on the resultant ETO and K-pan, but not E-pan, surfaces. Sensitivity analysis showed that results were particularly stable in the hydrologically active portion of the year extending from March to October, inclusive. This study demonstrated that high spatial resolution monthly surfaces of ETO can be spatially modelled while taking into account the influence of topography on the forcing variables.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.02.018,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.02.018

For this, the model performance of runs with different sets of Manning roughness coefficients, chosen from a range between . and ., are compared to inundation data and an outflow hydrograph. The influence of variation in the weighting coefficient of the numerical scheme is also investigated. For the latter, the empirical results show no advantage of using values below  and suggest the use of a fully implicit scheme (weighting parameter equals ). The results of varying the reach scale roughnesses shows that many parameter sets can perform equally well (problem of equifinality) even with extreme values. However, this depends on the model region and boundary conditions. The necessity to distinguish between effective parameters and real physical parameters is emphasised.

In this study, a non-dimensional relative sensitivity coefficient was employed to predict responses of ETref to perturbations of four climatic variables in the Changjiang (Yangtze River) basin. ETref was estimated with the FAO- Penman-Monteith equation. A -year historical dataset of daily air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and daily sunshine duration at  national meteorological observatory stations was used in the analysis. Results show that the response of ETref can be precisely predicted under perturbation of relative humidity or shortwave radiation by their sensitivity coefficients; the predictive power under perturbations of air temperature and wind speed depended on the magnitude of the perturbation, season and region. The prediction errors were much smaller than the seasonal and regional variation of their sensitivity coefficients. The sensitivity coefficient could also be used to predict the response of ETref to co-perturbation of several variables. The accuracy of the prediction increases from the lower to the upper region. Spatial variations of long-term average monthly and yearly sensitivity coefficients were obtained by interpolation of station estimates. In general, relative humidity was the most sensitive variable, followed by shortwave radiation, air temperature and wind speed. The actual rank of the four climatic variables in terms of their sensitivity varied with season and region. The large spatial variability of the sensitivity coefficients of all the climatic variables in the middle and tower regions of the basin was to a large extent determined by the distinct wind-speed patterns in those two regions.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.03.027,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.03.027

The MRA relies on an orthogonal projection of uncertain data and solution variables onto a multi-wavelet basis, consisting of compact piecewise-smooth polynomial functions. The coefficients of the expansion are computed through a Galerkin procedure. The MRA scheme is applied to the simulation of the Lorenz system having a single random parameter. The convergence of the solution with respect to the resolution level and expansion order is investigated. In particular, results are compared to two Monte-Carlo sampling strategies, demonstrating the superiority of the MRA. For more complex problems, however, the MRA approach may require excessive CPU times. Adaptive methods are consequently developed in order to overcome this drawback. Two approaches are explored: the first is based on adaptive refinement of the multi-wavelet basis, while the second is based on adaptive block-partitioning of the space of random variables. Computational tests indicate that the latter approach is better suited for large problems, leading to a more efficient, flexible and parallelizable scheme.",10.1016/j.jcp.2003.12.020,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2003.12.020

Traditional methods of graphically comparing computational and experimental results, though valuable, are essentially qualitative. Computable measures are needed that can quantitatively compare computational and experimental results over a range of input, or control, variables to sharpen assessment of computational accuracy. This type of measure has been recently referred to as a validation metric. We discuss various features that we believe should be incorporated in a validation metric, as well as features that we believe should be excluded. We develop a new validation metric that is based on the statistical concept of confidence intervals. Using this fundamental concept, we construct two specific metrics: one that requires interpolation of experimental data and one that requires regression (curve fitting) of experimental data. We apply the metrics to three example problems: thermal decomposition of a polyurethane foam, a turbulent buoyant plume of helium, and compressibility effects on the growth rate of a turbulent free-shear layer. We discuss how the present metrics are easily interpretable for assessing computational model accuracy, as well as the impact of experimental measurement uncertainty on the accuracy assessment.",10.1016/j.jcp.2006.03.037,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2006.03.037

Further, the inclusion of inertia effects significantly alters the physics, enabling solutions of new classes of optimization problems, such as velocity-driven switches, that are not addressed by the earlier method. Specifically, we determine optimal layouts of channel flows that extremize a cost function which measures either some local aspect of the velocity field or a global quantity, such as the rate of energy dissipation. We use the finite element method to model the flow, and we solve the optimization problem with a gradient-based math-programming algorithm that is driven by analytical sensitivities.

Many questions regarding how to property calibrate and validate distributed models and assess the uncertainty of the estimated parameters and the spatially-distributed responses are, however, still quite unexplored. Especially for complex models, rigorous parameterization, reduction of the parameter space and use of efficient and effective algorithms are essential to facilitate the calibration process and make it more robust. Moreover, for these models multi-site validation must complement the usual time validation. In this study, we develop, through an application, a comprehensive framework for multi-criteria calibration and uncertainty assessment of distributed physically-based, integrated hydrological, models. A revised version of the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) procedure based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is applied in order to improve the performance of the methodology in estimating parameters and posterior output distributions. The description of the spatial variations of the hydrological. processes is accounted for by defining a measure of model performance that includes multiple criteria and spatially-distributed information. An initial sensitivity analysis is conducted on the model to avoid overparameterisation and to increase the robustness of the approach. It is demonstrated that the employed methodology increases the identifiability of the parameters and results in satisfactory multi-variable simulations and uncertainty estimates.

The full factorial numerical integration, the univariate dimension reduction method, and the polynomial chaos expansion method are implemented and applied to several test problems. They are tested under different settings of the performance nonlinearity, distribution types of input random variables, and the magnitude of input uncertainty. The performances of those methods are compared in moment estimation, tail probability calculation, and the probability density function construction, corresponding to a wide variety of scenarios of design under uncertainty, such as robust design, and reliability-based design optimization.

This is achieved by approximating the reliability constraints based on the reliability analysis results. The proposed approach does not use inverse first-order reliability analysis as other existing decoupled approaches, but uses direct reliability analysis. This strategy allows a modular approach and the use of more accurate methods, including Monte-Carlo-simulation (MCS)-based methods for highly nonlinear reliability constraints where first-order reliability approximation may not be accurate. The use of simulation-based methods also enables system-level reliability estimates to be included in the RBDO formulation. The efficiency of the proposed RBDO approach is further improved by identifying the potentially active reliability constraints at the beginning of each reliability analysis.

The method is based on an enhanced hybrid mean value (HMV+) analysis in the performance measure approach (PMA) for numerical stability and efficiency in search of the most probable point (MPP). The HMV+ method improves numerical stability and efficiency especially for highly nonlinear output performance functions by providing steady convergent behavior in the MPP search. The proposed adaptive probability analysis method approximates the MPP locus, and then adaptively refines this locus using an a posteriori error estimator. Using the fact that probability levels can be easily set a priori in PMA, the MPP locus is approximated using the interpolated moving least-squares method. For refinement of the approximated MPP locus, additional probability levels are adaptively determined through an a posteriori error estimator. The adaptive probability analysis method will determine the minimum number of necessary probability levels, while ensuring accuracy of the approximated MPP locus.

Thr large deformation of the material during impact loading is described through an anisotropic plasticity model in total Lagrangian co-ordinates whose coefficients are determined experimentally. The interaction between lamina is analyzed through a contact/interface model. The tensile and shear tractions in zero thickness interface elements, embedded between lamina, are calculated from interface cohesive law. The interface cohesive law describes the evolution of these tractions in terms of normal and tangential displacement jumps and other interface parameters. The compressive traction at the interface is calculated through the impenetrability condition employed in the contact module. Once the effective dis placement jump exceeds a specified critical value, the interface elements are assumed to have failed, i.e., delamination is said to have taken place. Three interface cohesive laws are proposed to describe the delamination process. It is assumed that loading of interface takes place reversibly up to a specified value of the displacement jump Followed by irreversible loading beyond this value. This feature represents a partial damage of the interface in the event of unloading. Dynamic delamination in the woven GRP composite is studied through analyses of plate-on-plate impact experiments. The heterogeneity of composite materials leading to wave dispersion and scattering is modeled by considering a layered composition of the GRP plate. Each lamina is assumed to be made of three layers of materials. The middle layer of half the thickness of lamina is considered as GRP and the two end layers of equal thicknesses are considered to be of matrix material, i.e., polyester resin. The possible delamination of the composite material under compressive shock loading is shown to occur due to local shear effects. This is modeled by considering waviness of the interface between lamina, Interfaces with Aat as well as two types of wavy structures are analyzed. Analyses are carried out to establish the effect of critical displacement jump, mixed mode coupling parameter employed in interface laws, interface waviness and the effect of interface laws. The response of GRP composite during impact is characterized in terms of the free surface velocity, delamination event vs, time and interface normal and shear stresses, The interface normal and shear stresses are obtained directly from the interface cohesive laws, as well as, by extrapolating continuum stresses From integration points of the neighboring triangular elements to the interface.:It is shown that the finite element model predicts the response of the material in confirmation with the available experimental results.

Subsequently, a sensitivity analysis of a reference evapotranspiration model is carried out to determine the most sensible meteorological variables. The sensitivity coefficients were then combined with the errors due to the temporal sampling to quantify for each variable the impact of the sampling frequency on the estimation of daily ETo. The results showed that the solar radiation and the wind speed are the most sensitive to bias induced by inadequate temporal sampling frequency. Daily errors of .

The uncertainty of model parameters is one of the major uncertainty sources in hydrological modelling. The aim of this study is to quantify the parameter uncertainty in Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model using bootstrap method with application to Yingluoxia watershed located in the upper reaches of Heihe River basin. Bootstrap method is a nonparametric technique for simulating the parameter distribution. Nine sensitive aggregate parameters are investigated. The results from bootstrap method show that six of the nine marginal distributions are not normally distributed and each parameter has its own uncertainty range. Further investigation about the effects of parameter uncertainty on simulation results shows that although the parameter uncertainty is one of the important sources of uncertainties, its contribution to simulation uncertainty is relatively small. Only -% of the observed runoff data fall inside the % simulation confidence intervals in the calibration and validation periods.

The statistical uncertainty is studied using a Monte Carlo procedure. The model uncertainty is investigated by the comparison of four different mixing models all based on the same tracers but considering for each component alternative hypotheses about their concentration and their spatio-temporal variability. This analysis indicates that despite the uncertainty, the flow sources, which generate the stream flow are clearly identified at the catchments scale by the application of the mixing model.

In the present study, the heat source is assumed to satisfy a second-order partial differential equation on a physical basis, thereby transforming the problem into a fourth-order partial differential equation, which can be conveniently solved using the MFS. Since the matrix arising from the MFS discretization is severely ill-conditioned, a regularized solution is obtained by employing the truncated singular value decomposition, whilst the optimal regularization parameter is determined by the L-curve criterion.

Our emphasis is on situations where a very large number of random variables is needed to model the coefficient field. As an alternative to classical Monte Carlo, we here employ quasi-Monte Carlo methods, which use deterministically chosen sample points in an appropriate (usually high-dimensional) parameter space. Each realization of the PDE solution requires a finite element (FE) approximation in space, and this is done using a realization of the coefficient field restricted to a suitable regular spatial grid (not necessarily the same as the FE grid).

Uncertainty, both from parameters and model, is introduced by randomizing the coefficients of the reduced order model in a manner that guarantees the physical appropriateness of every realization of the reduced order model, i.e. while maintaining the fundamental properties of symmetry and positive definiteness of every such reduced order model. This randomization is achieved not by postulating a specific joint statistical distribution of the reduced order model coefficients but rather by deriving this distribution through the principle of maximization of the entropy constrained to satisfy the necessary symmetry and positive definiteness properties. Several desirable features of this approach are that the uncertainty can be characterized by a single measure of dispersion, affects all coefficients of the reduced order model, and is computationally easily achieved.

One of them is related to the ""a priori"" hypotheses involved in the uncertainty analysis. Such hypotheses are usually condensed in ""a priori"" distributions assessing the most likely values for model parameters.

The results show that a uniform distribution should be applied whenever no information is available for specific parameters describing the case study. The use of weak information (mostly coming from literature or other model applications) should be avoided because it can lead to wrong estimations of uncertainty in modelling results.

In this paper, we introduce a formalism based on kinetic theory to tackle uncertain hyperbolic systems of conservation laws with Polynomial Chaos (PC) methods. The idea is to introduce a new variable, the entropic variable, in bijection with our vector of unknowns, which we develop on the polynomial basis: by performing a Galerkin projection, we obtain a deterministic system of conservation laws. We state several properties of this deterministic system in the case of a general uncertain system of conservation laws. We then apply the method to the case of the inviscid Burgers' equation with random initial conditions and we present some preliminary results for the Euler system. We systematically compare results from our new approach to results from the stochastic Galerkin method. In the vicinity of discontinuities, the new method bounds the oscillations due to Gibbs phenomenon to a certain range through the entropy of the system without the use of any adaptative random space discretizations.

Therein, the design objective is to minimize the structural vibration level at specified positions by distributing a given amount of damping material. An artificial damping material model that has a similar form as in the SIMP approach is suggested and the relative densities of the damping material are taken as design variables. The vibration equation of the structure has a non-proportional damping matrix. A system reduction procedure is first performed by using the eigenmodes of the undamped system. The complex mode superposition method in the state space, which can deal with the non-proportional damping, is then employed to calculate the steady-state response of the vibrating structure. In this context, an adjoint variable scheme for the response sensitivity analysis is developed. Numerical examples are presented for illustrating validity and efficiency of this approach.

A level set model is established mathematically as the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to capture the motion of the free boundary of a continuum structure. The structural design boundary is thus described implicitly as the zero level set of a level set scalar function of higher dimension. The radial basis function with compact support is then applied to interpolate the level set function, leading to a relaxation and separation of the temporal and spatial discretizations related to the original partial differential equation. In doing so, the more difficult shape and topology optimization problem is now fully parameterized into a relatively easier size optimization of generalized expansion coefficients. As a result, the optimization is changed into a numerical process of implementing a series of motions of the implicit level set function via an existing efficient convex programming method. With the concept of the shape derivative, the geometrical non-linearity is included in the rigorous design sensitivity analysis to appropriately capture the large displacements of compliant mechanisms. Several numerical benchmark examples illustrate the effectiveness of the present level set method, in particular, its capability of generating new holes inside the material domain. The proposed method not only retains the favorable features of the implicit free boundary representation but also overcomes several unfavorable numerical considerations relevant to the explicit scheme, the reinitialization procedure, and the velocity extension algorithm in the conventional level set method.",10.1002/nme.2352,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nme.2352

Numerical models, such as VFSMOD-W, offer a mechanistic approach for evaluating VFS effectiveness under various hydrological conditions including concentrated flow. This research hypothesizes that the presence of concentrated flow drastically alters the importance of various hydrological, sedimentological, and pesticide input factors and the prediction uncertainty of pesticide reduction. Using data from a VFS experimental field study investigating chlorpyrifos and atrazine transport, a two-step global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis framework was used with VFSMOD-W based on () a screening method (Morris) and () a variance-based method (extended Fourier Analysis Sensitivity Test, FAST). The vertical, saturated hydraulic conductivity was consistently the most important input factor for predicting infiltration, explaining % of total output variance for uniform sheet flow, but only % for concentrated flow. Sedimentation was governed by both hydrologic (vertical, saturated hydraulic conductivity and initial and saturated water content) and sediment characteristics (average particle diameter). The vertical, saturated hydraulic conductivity was the most important input factor for atrazine or chlorpyrifos trapping under uniform sheet flow (explained more than % of the total output variance) and concentrated flow (although only explained % of the total variance in this case). The % confidence intervals for atrazine and chlorpyrifos reduction ranged between % and % for uniform sheet flow and decreased to between % and % under concentrated flow. Concentrated flow increased interactions among the system components, enhancing the relative importance of processes that were latent under shallow flow conditions.

The presence of a litter should therefore be accounted for in forest SVAT models, especially when long-term simulations are to be performed. A heat and moisture litter model has been developed by adding two dynamical equations to a force-restore type soil model. The experimental data used for the model validation was collected in a pine forest canopy in the South-West of France, that was part of the Euroflux network. The model is tested and validated over a two-year period. It is shown to provide a fairly good simulation of soil and litter moisture, soil and litter temperature and turbulent fluxes measured above the forest floor. It is also shown that simulations without the litter layer are unable to reproduce all these variables simultaneously. We then perform a sensitivity analysis to the parameters whose values are either uncertain or likely to be variable in time and space, such as the litter thickness, the rainfall fraction intercepted by the litter or the maximum value of the surface resistance.

To date, several detailed mathematical models are available to predict stormwater quantity-quality characteristics in urban drainage systems. However, only a few models take sewer sediments into account, considering their cohesive-like properties that influence the build-up process of the pollutant load. Furthermore, the model data requirements, especially for the quality aspects, are extensive, which limit their applicability and affect model results with large uncertainty. Uncertainty analysis provides a measure or index regarding the significance and the accuracy of the results obtained by mathematical modelling and is therefore of high interest. Nevertheless, only few studies have been carried out in the urban drainage field, and very few deal with water quality issues. One of the main reasons for this lack of research is the computational burden required by detailed models that preserve this analysis and generally require several Monte Carlo simulation runs. A possible to this problem may be the adoption of simplified parsimonious models that generally require shorter computational times. In this context, this paper presents a parsimonious conceptual model for the evaluation of the pollutant load in-sewers. The model contains two modules: a hydrological and hydraulic module that calculates the hydrographs at the inlet and at the outlet of the sewer system, and a solid transfer module that calculates the pollutographs. The cohesive properties of sewer sediments were carefully considered. Further, the effectiveness of the innovative sewer sediment modelling approach has been verified by taking into account the uncertainty assessed according to the GLUE methodology.

Smolyak, Quadrature and interpolation formulas for tensor products of certain classes of functions, Soviet Math. Dokl.  () -], to approximate the stochastic solution locally. The adaptive strategy is governed by the hierarchical surpluses, which are computed as part of the interpolation procedure. These hierarchical surpluses then serve as an error indicator for each subdomain, and lead to subdivision whenever it becomes greater than a threshold value. The hierarchical surpluses also provide information about the more important dimensions, and accordingly the random elements can be split along those dimensions.

These models require the specification of many surface properties which can generally be obtained from laboratory or field experiments, using time consuming techniques, or can be derived from textural information. The required accuracy of the surface properties depends on the model complexity and their misspecification can affect model performance. At various time and spatial resolutions, remote sensing provides information related to surface parameters in SVAT models or state variables simulated by SVAT models.

We introduce an alternative subsurface flow parameterization into VIC-L to reduce the impacts of model parameter uncertainties on model simulations by reducing the number of model parameters that need to be estimated through a calibration process. The new subsurface flow parameterization is based on the concepts of kinematic wave and hydrologic similarity, and has one parameter for calibration. Results from the  MOPEX (Model Parameter Estimation Experiment) basins obtained by applying the VIC-L model with the new subsurface flow formulation show that the performance of the new parameterization is comparable to the original subsurface flow formulation, which has three parameters for calibration. In addition, a probabilistic approach based on Monte Carlo simulations is used to evaluate model performance and uncertainties associated with model parameters over different ranges of streamflow. Studies based on the  MOPEX watersheds show that compared to the parameter associated with the new subsurface flow parameterization, the VIC shape parameter (i.e. the b parameter that represents the shape of the heterogeneity distribution of effective soil moisture capacity over a study area) has a larger impact on model simulations and could introduce more uncertainty if not estimated appropriately. Furthermore, investigations on the b parameter suggest that the ensembles (i.e. the mean response and its bounds) from the Monte Carlo simulations could provide reasonable predictions and uncertainty estimates of streamflows, which have important implications for applications to ungauged basins. The study also shows that appropriate reduction of the number of model parameters is an effective approach to reduce the impacts of parameter uncertainties on model simulations. This is more so for applications to ungauged basins or basins with limited data available for calibration. The new subsurface flow parameterization and the probabilistic uncertainty analysis approach are general and can be applied to other modeling studies.

Based on the experimental observations, two empirical equations were proposed for parametric expression of the Forchheimer's nonlinear coefficient, one as a power function of hydraulic aperture and the other dependent on both hydraulic aperture and peak asperity of the fracture surface. A new criterion was presented for assessing the applicability of Darcy's law, which relies on the ratio of discharge or pressure gradient predicted by the Forchheimer's law incorporated with the single-parameter equation to that predicted by the Darcy's law. A sensitivity analysis was performed using the double-parameter equation for examining the dependence of the Forchheimer's nonlinear coefficient on peak asperity, demonstrating the importance of incorporating the fracture roughness in the development of non-Darcy flow models. The experimental results and the proposed models are useful for understanding and numerical modeling of the nonlinear flow behaviors in fractured aquifers.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.09.021,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.09.021
"Huang, YC | Yeh, HD",2007,The use of sensitivity analysis in on-line aquifer parameter estimation,Applications_JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,44,4.0,"Generally, a pumping test requires a lot of effort and expense to perform the test and the drawdown is measured and analyzed for determining the aquifer parameters. The estimated aquifer parameters obtained from graphical approaches may not be in good accuracy if the pumping time is too short to give a good visual fit to the type curve. Yet, the problems of tong pumping time and required efforts can be significantly reduced if the drawdown data are measured and the parameters are simultaneously estimated on-Line. However, the drawdown behavior of the Leaky and unconfined aquifers in response to the pumping may have a time tag and the time to terminate the estimation may not be easily and quickly to decide when applying a parameter estimation model (PEM) on-Line to analyze the parameters. This study uses the sensitivity analysis to explore the influence period of each aquifer parameter to the pumping drawdown and the influence period is used as a guide in terminating the estimation when applying the PEM for on-line parameter identification. In addition, the sensitivity analysis is also used to study the effects of different value of S-y and the distance between pumping well and observation well on the influence time of S-y during the pumping.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.12.007,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.12.007

"Allen, M | Maute, K",2004,Reliability-based design optimization of aeroelastic structures,Applications_STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION,43,3.07,"Aeroelastic phenomena are most often either ignored or roughly approximated when uncertainties are considered in the design optimization process of structures subject to aerodynamic loading, affecting the quality of the optimization results. Therefore, a design methodology is proposed that combines reliability-based design optimization and high-fidelity aeroelastic simulations for the analysis and design of aeroelastic structures. To account for uncertainties in design and operating conditions, a first-order reliability method (FORM) is employed to approximate the system reliability. To limit model uncertainties while accounting for the effects of given uncertainties, a high-fidelity nonlinear aeroelastic simulation method is used. The structure is modelled by a finite element method, and the aerodynamic loads are predicted by a finite volume discretization of a nonlinear Euler flow. The usefulness of the employed reliability analysis in both describing the effects of uncertainties on a particular design and as a design tool in the optimization process is illustrated. Though computationally more expensive than a deterministic optimum, due to the necessity of solving additional optimization problems for reliability analysis within each step of the broader design optimization procedure, a reliability-based optimum is shown to be an improved design. Conventional deterministic aeroelastic tailoring, which exploits the aeroelastic nature of the structure to enhance performance, is shown to often produce designs that are sensitive to variations in system or operational parameters.",10.1007/s00158-004-0384-1,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00158-004-0384-1
"Leven, C | Dietrich, P",2006,What information can we get from pumping tests? - comparing pumping test configurations using sensitivity coefficients,Applications_JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,42,3.5,"In this paper we present a comparison of two different pumping test configurations by means of sensitivity coefficients. Sensitivity coefficients, which are a measure for the relationship between a change in drawdown and a change in the parameter distribution, allow the analysis of the intrinsic characteristics of pumping tests in order to provide a better understanding of their response to aquifer heterogeneity. By considering the evolution of changes in the sensitivity distribution, a direct link between temporal and spatial information is given. Thus, any deviation in the parameter distribution in a particular area around the wells of the considered test configuration can be assigned to deviations in the drawdown Curve indicated by a changing slope. Consequently, sensitivity coefficients allow the assessment of temporal information from the drawdown curve. By means of sensitivity coefficients it can be shown that the spatial assignment of estimated parameters is much simpler for single-well than for two-well pumping tests. Based on a numerical example, difficulties and consequences arising from pumping test evaluation are illustrated as result of the intrinsic characteristics of the test configuration due to the particularities of the sensitivity distribution. In this context, misinterpretations resulting from the application of interpretation methods-such as the Theis Solution for the classical two-well pumping test-are demonstrated that might lead to inaccurate estimates of hydraulic parameters.

This advantage of force-based elements is of even more interest in structural reliability analysis, which requires accurate and efficient computation of structural response and structural response sensitivities. This paper focuses on material non-linearities in the context of both static and dynamic response analysis.

However, this procedure remains time-consuming and a single simulation can request several hours. As a consequence, the influence of uncertain input parameters on the SAR cannot be analyzed using crude Monte Carlo simulation. The solution presented here to perform such an analysis is surrogate modeling. This paper proposes a novel approach to build such a surrogate model from a design of experiments. Considering a sparse representation of the polynomial chaos expansions using least-angle regression as a selection algorithm to retain the most influential polynomials, this paper proposes to use the selected polynomials as regression functions for the universal Kriging model. The leave-one-outcross validation is used to select the optimal number of polynomials in the deterministic part of the Kriging model.

The performances of the LARS-Kriging-PC are compared to an ordinary Kriging model and to a classical sparse polynomial chaos expansion. The LARS-Kriging-PC appears to have better performances than the two other approaches. A significant accuracy improvement is observed compared to the ordinary Kriging or to the sparse polynomial chaos depending on the studied case.

The results indicate that several best performing structures yielded quite similar levels of efficiency.

The design objectives characterize the performance in the undeformed and deformed configurations. The layout of fluid channels is determined by material topology optimization. In addition, the thickness distribution, the distribution of active material for internal actuation, and the support conditions are optimized. The coupled fluid-structure response is predicted by a non-linear finite element model and a hydrodynamic lattice Boltzmann method. Focusing on applications with low flow velocities and pressures, structural deformations due to fluidforces are neglected. A mapping scheme is presented that couples the material distributions in the structural and fluid mesh.

The main contribution of the paper is using the geometric reconstruction technique that is mathematically sound and error bounded for creating solid models of the topologically optimized structures with smooth geometric boundary. This geometric reconstruction method extends the integration to -D applications. In addition, commercial Computer-Aided Design (CAD), finite element analysis (FEA), optimization, and application software tools are incorporated to support the integrated optimization process. The integration is carried out by first converting the geometry of the topologically optimized structure into smooth and parametric B-spline curves and surfaces. The B-spline curves and surfaces are then imported into a parametric CAD environment to build solid models of the structure. The control point movements of the B-spline curves or surfaces are defined as design variables for shape optimization, in which CAD-based design velocity field computations, design sensitivity analysis (DSA), and nonlinear programming are performed.

The technique is based on the continuous detection of the sharp colour changes caused on an aqueous solution, as the solute concentration varies, because of the strong sensitivity of a system of indicators to pH. Image analysis is used for the transformation of the spatial distribution of colour intensity to solute concentration profiles. Unidirectional miscible displacement and single source-solute transport experiments are used to identify and quantify the transient and steady-state solute dispersion regimes in a pore network, and estimate the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients as functions of Peclet number. The dispersion coefficients are estimated by fitting the spatial/temporal distribution of solute concentration over various regions of the network to analytic solutions of the convection-dispersion equation, obtained by using a flux-type boundary condition at solute sources.

LSPIV belongs to the methods of local remote sensing of rivers, like Radar- and Lidar-based techniques. These methods have many potential advantages, in comparison with classical river gauging, but they have a fundamental drawback: they are indirect measurements. As such they need to be assessed in reference to direct measurements. A first validation method consists in the comparison of LSPIV measurements with classic gauging results, in field and laboratory experiments. Unfortunately, in both cases, it is impossible in practice to control, all the parameters and to distinguish the impact of the various error sources. In the present study we propose a more theoretical assessment of LSPIV potential through numerical simulation. The idea is simply to mathematically formulate the present state of knowledge of the measurement including both the physics of the phenomenon (the illuminated river) and the physics of the sensor (the camera and the PIV tracking). The dilemma about when to start this type of simulation is the following: The simulation is satisfactory if we can validate it which means to be able to compare simulations and observations over a wide range of conditions. The simulation is useful to get preliminary insights about the most important measurement conditions to organize validation studies. Our simulator is composed of three blocks: () The river block represents the unidirectional river flow by the association of the EDM model and a theoretical vertical velocity profile giving a D velocity distribution. This hydraulic model is complemented by features representing free surface tracers, the illumination of the free-surface (shadows and sun reflection) and the effect of the wind. () The camera block transforms the river state parameters into raster images according to the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera. () The LSPIV analysis block performs a classical LSPIV analysis, including geometric transformation of the images, PIV analysis to obtain a surface velocity field, and discharge computation. We tried to keep a good balance between the different blocks of the simulator (i.e. not to make one component much more sophisticated than the others). The simulator was partly tested during the development of its different blocks, and then globally validated. It reproduced well the variability observed in the field LSPIV experiments conducted with the real-time continuous system of Hauet et al.

Analysis of the parameter uncertainty in reservoir operating rules and their impact is necessary for robust solutions. In the present study, parameter uncertainty for reservoir operating rules is analyzed using two statistical methods, linear regression (LR) and Bayesian simulation (BS). LR estimates the confidence interval based on fitting the operating rules to the optimal deterministic solution. BS deals with the operating rule parameters as stochastic variables and treats the goodness-of-fit to the optimal deterministic solution or the operation profits as the likelihood measure. Two alternative techniques, the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC), are implemented for the BS uncertainty analysis. These methods were applied to the operating rules of China's Three Gorges Reservoir. The LR performed less than the BS, and the MCMC outperformed the GLUE.

Hence, the TDF approach may be used to carry out topology optimization, i.e. to solve the material distribution problem. However, the material distribution problem may be ill-posed. This ill-posedness can be avoided by limiting the complexity of the design, which is accomplished automatically by limiting the number of design parameters used for the TDF. An important feature is that the TDF design description is entirely decoupled from a finite element (FE) model. The basic idea of the TDF approach is as follows. In the TDF approach, the design variables are parameters that determine a function on the so-called reference domain. Using a cut-off level, this function unambiguously determines a geometry. Then, the performance of this geometry is determined by a FE analysis. Several optimization techniques are applied to the TDF approach to carry out topology optimization. First, a genetic algorithm is applied, with (too) large computational costs. The TDF approach is shown to work using a heuristic iterative adaptation of the design parameters.

Analyzing it becomes an important task particularly when impact analysis results are used for adaptation purposes. A methodology aiming to investigate the impact of climate change and the separate and combined impacts of several uncertainty sources on future extreme flows in the Lanjiang catchment, East China is proposed. A regional climate model PRECIS (Providing REgional Climates for Impacts Studies) is applied to downscale the General Circulation Model (GCM) outputs and the extreme flows are simulated by the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model. Besides emission scenarios and extreme value models, the main uncertainty source, namely SWAT parameters is taken into account and the sequential uncertainty analysis method is employed to analyze the parameter uncertainties. The SWAT model calibration and validation results indicate that the model has a good performance in Lanjiang catchment. The projected future extreme flows show that the design discharges of small return periods are likely larger than those in the baseline period, while those of large return periods will be likely smaller than those in the baseline period at Misai, Quzhou and Lanxi stations.

The rise of finite element (FEM) simulations for processes has contributed to these goals in a major way. More recently, coupling FEM simulations to mathematical optimisation techniques has shown the potential to make a further giant contribution to product improvement and cost reduction. Much research on the optimisation of metal forming processes has been published during the last couple of years. Although the results are impressive, the optimisation techniques are generally only applicable to specific optimisation problems for specific products and specific metal forming processes. As a consequence, applying optimisation techniques to other metal forming problems requires a lot of optimisation expertise, which forms a barrier for more general industrial application of these techniques. In this paper, we overcome this barrier by proposing a generally applicable optimisation strategy that makes use of FEM simulations of metal forming processes. It consists of a structured methodology for modelling optimisation problems related to metal forming. Subsequently, screening is applied to reduce the size of the optimisation problem by selecting only the most important design variables. Finally, the reduced optimisation problem is solved by an efficient optimisation algorithm. The strategy is generally applicable in a sense that it is not constrained to a certain type of metal forming problem, product or process. Also, any FEM code may be included in the strategy. Furthermore, the structured approach for modelling and solving optimisation problems should enable non-optimisation specialists to apply optimisation techniques to improve their products and processes.

The latter aspect is addressed in the present contribution. In order to guarantee the quality of the numerical results the discretization error of the finite element solution is controlled and the finite element discretization is adaptively refined during the optimization process.

"Forsberg, J | Nilsson, L",2007,Topology optimization in crashworthiness design,Applications_STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION,30,2.73,"Topology optimization has developed rapidly, primarily with application on linear elastic structures subjected to static loadcases. In its basic form, an approximated optimization problem is formulated using analytical or semi-analytical methods to perform the sensitivity analysis. When an explicit finite element method is used to solve contact-impact problems, the sensitivities cannot easily be found. Hence, the engineer is forced to use numerical derivatives or other approaches. Since each finite element simulation of an impact problem may take days of computing time, the sensitivity-based methods are not a useful approach. Therefore, two alternative formulations for topology optimization are investigated in this work. The fundamental approach is to remove elements or, alternatively, change the element thicknesses based on the internal energy density distribution in the model. There is no automatic shift between the two methods within the existing algorithm. Within this formulation, it is possible to treat nonlinear effects, e.g., contact-impact and plasticity. Since no sensitivities are used, the updated design might be a step in the wrong direction for some finite elements. The load paths within the model will change if elements are removed or the element thicknesses are altered. Therefore, care should be taken with this procedure so that small steps are used, i.e., the change of the model should not be too large between two successive iterations and, therefore, the design parameters should not be altered too much. It is shown in this paper that the proposed method for topology optimization of a nonlinear problem gives similar result as a standard topology optimization procedures for the linear elastic case. Furthermore, the proposed procedures allow for topology optimization of nonlinear problems. The major restriction of the method is that responses in the optimization formulation must be coupled to the thickness updating procedure, e.g., constraint on a nodal displacement, acceleration level that is allowed.",10.1007/s00158-006-0040-z,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00158-006-0040-z

Understanding of the physical processes and parameters determining heat transport is therefore important. In this paper, heat transport is studied during a shallow heat injection and storage field test. The test is simulated using SEAWAT. Sensitivity analyses and collinear diagnostics are used to derive which parameters can be derived from the test and how reliable these values are. Heat transport during the test is compared with heat transport in the surficial zone at the same field site to compare parameter values. The most sensitive parameter is the thermal conductivity of the solid followed by the porosity, heat capacity of the solid and the longitudinal dispersivity. This indicates the predominance of conductive transport during the storage phase over the convective transport during the injection phase. Whereas heat transport in the surficial zone is insensitive to the longitudinal dispersivity, this parameter must be included to simulate the field test. This indicates that dispersivity cannot be ignored simulating convective heat transport in aquifers.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.08.024,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.08.024

The problem of a thin-walled composite circular cylinder under axial buckling instability is used as a demonstrative example. In this case, the global technique uses a single second-order RS model to estimate the axial buckling load over the entire feasible design space (FDS), whereas the local technique uses multiple first-order RS models, with each applied to a small subregion of the FDS. Alternative methods for the calculation of unknown coefficients in each RS model are explored prior to the solution of the optimization problem. The example RBO problem is formulated as a function of  uncorrelated random variables that include material properties, the thickness and orientation angle of each ply, the diameter and length of the cylinder, as well as the applied load. The mean values of the  ply thicknesses are treated as independent design variables. While the coefficients of variation of all random variables are held fixed, the standard deviations of the ply thicknesses can vary during the optimization process as a result of changes in the design variables. The structural reliability analysis is based on the first-order reliability method with the reliability index treated as the design constraint. In addition to the probabilistic sensitivity analysis of the reliability index, the results of the RBO problem are presented for different combinations of cylinder length and diameter and laminate ply patterns. The two strategies are found to produce similar results in terms of accuracy, with the sequential local RS technique having a considerably better computational efficiency.",10.1007/s00158-003-0353-0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00158-003-0353-0

In reliability quantification, classical probabilistic analysis has been a popular approach in many engineering disciplines. However, when we cannot obtain sufficient data to construct probability distributions in a large-complex system, the classical probability methodology may not be appropriate to quantify the uncertainty. Evidence theory, also called Dempster-Shafer Theory, has the potential to quantify aleatory (random) and epistemic (subjective) uncertainties because it can directly handle insufficient data and incomplete knowledge situations. In this paper, interval information is assumed for the best representation of imprecise information, and the sensitivity analysis of plausibility in evidence theory is analytically derived with respect to expert opinions and structural parameters.

In this method, the input parameters with epistemic uncertainty are modeled using interval variables while input parameters with aleatory uncertainty are modeled using probability distribution or random variables. In order to calculate the lower and upper bounds of system probabilities of failure, both the best case and the worst case scenarios of the system performance function need to be considered, and the proposed MVFOSPA-UUA method can handle these two cases easily.

In this paper, an approach to shape optimization using Eulerian representation such that the mesh distortion problem in the conventional approach can be resolved is proposed. A continuum geometric model is defined on the fixed grid of finite elements. An active set of finite elements that defines the discrete domain is determined using a procedure similar to topology optimization, in which each element has a unique shape density. The shape design parameter that is defined on the geometric model is transformed into the corresponding shape density variation of the boundary elements. Using this transformation, it has been shown that the shape design problem can be treated as a parameter design problem, which is a much easier method than the former. A detailed derivation of how the shape design velocity field can be converted into the shape density variation is presented along with sensitivity calculation. Very efficient sensitivity coefficients are calculated by integrating only those elements that belong to the structural boundary.

The sensitivities were computed using three methods: Sobol's indices, the mutual entropy and regional sensitivity analysis (RSA). The calculations were carried out for different temporal scales of evaluation ranging from daily to a multiannual period. A comparison of the methods shows that the mutual entropy and the RSA methods give more robust results than Sobol's method, which shows a higher variability in the sensitivities when they are calculated using different data sets. While all sensitivity methods are suitable for identifying the most sensitive parameters of a model, there are increasing differences in the results when the parameters become less important and also when shorter temporal scales are considered. A correlation analysis further indicated that the periods in which the parameter sensitivity rankings did not agree between the different methods are characterized by a higher impact of the parameters interactions on the modeled discharge. An analysis of the parameter sensitivity across the scales showed that the number of important parameter decreases when longer evaluation periods are considered. For instance, it was observed that all parameters were important at least during  day a daily scale, while at a yearly scale only the parameters characterizing the soil storage and the recession constants for interflow and percolation had high sensitivities. With respect to the impact of the interactions between parameters on the model results, it was observed that the largest effect is related to the parameters describing the size of the soil storage, the interflow and the percolation flow recession constants. Further, it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the importance of the interactions and the measured discharge. While the study focuses on quantitative sensitivity measures, it is also highlighted that graphical RSA analyses provide additional information regarding the parameter ranges associated with different discharge levels.

The objective of our method is to exploit some intrinsic sparse structure in the stochastic solution by constructing the sparsest representation of the stochastic solution via a bi-orthogonal basis. It is well-known that the Karhunen-Loeve expansion (KLE) minimizes the total mean squared error and gives the sparsest representation of stochastic solutions. However, the computation of the KL expansion could be quite expensive since we need to form a covariance matrix and solve a large-scale eigenvalue problem. The main contribution of this paper is that we derive an equivalent system that governs the evolution of the spatial and stochastic basis in the KL expansion. Unlike other reduced model methods, our method constructs the reduced basis on-the-fly without the need to form the covariance matrix or to compute its eigendecomposition. In the first part of our paper, we introduce the derivation of the dynamically bi-orthogonal formulation for SPDEs, discuss several theoretical issues, such as the dynamic bi-orthogonality preservation and some preliminary error analysis of the DyBO method. We also give some numerical implementation details of the DyBO methods, including the representation of stochastic basis and techniques to deal with eigenvalue crossing.

The region is characterized by a paucity of accurate data and limited human resources, but the need for informed development decisions is critical to social and economic development. One of the main sources of uncertainty is related to the estimation of the parameters of hydrological models. This paper proposes a framework for establishing parameter values, exploring parameter inter-dependencies and setting parameter uncertainty bounds for a monthly time-step rainfall-runoff model (Pitman model) that is widely used in the region. The method is based on well-documented principles of sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, but recognizes the limitations that exist within the region (data scarcity and accuracy, model user attitudes, etc.). Four example applications taken from different climate and physiographic regions of South Africa illustrate that the methods are appropriate for generating behavioural stream flow simulations which include parameter uncertainty. The parameters that dominate the model response and their degree of uncertainty vary between regions. Some of the results suggest that the uncertainty bounds will be too wide for effective water resources decision making. Further work is required to reduce some of the subjectivity in the methods and to investigate other approaches for constraining the uncertainty.

At  locations on a hillslope, steady-state infiltration rates were measured at two applied pressure heads with a single-ring infiltrometer. The solution of two steady-state infiltration equations for each location (the simultaneous-equation approach, SEA) yielded  negative alpha-values,  positive alpha values and  positive K(fs)-values. The sensitivity of K(fs) and alpha to small measurement errors was estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation (MC). Results of this MC simulation showed that the uncertainty on alpha is extremely high while the uncertainty on K(fs) is fairly small. Hence, although the pressure infiltrometer technique as applied here is useful to estimate K(fs) at each measurement location, it is not suited for the estimation of an alpha-value at each measurement location. A new procedure is proposed for the simultaneous estimation of one overall 'field alpha' and the  K(fs) values of measurement locations having a positively calculated a using SEA.

Such situations are common in multiscale, intermittent and non-homogeneous fluid and ocean flows. The dynamically orthogonal (DO) field equations provide an adaptive methodology to predict the probability density functions of such flows. The present work derives efficient computational schemes for the DO methodology applied to unsteady stochastic Navier-Stokes and Boussinesq equations, and illustrates and studies the numerical aspects of these schemes. Semi-implicit projection methods are developed for the mean and for the DO modes, and time-marching schemes of first to fourth order are used for the stochastic coefficients. Conservative second-order finite-volumes are employed in physical space with new advection schemes based on total variation diminishing methods. Other results include: (i) the definition of pseudo-stochastic pressures to obtain a number of pressure equations that is linear in the subspace size instead of quadratic; (ii) symmetric advection schemes for the stochastic velocities; (iii) the use of generalized inversion to deal with singular subspace covariances or deterministic modes; and (iv) schemes to maintain orthonormal modes at the numerical level.

Furthermore, in large rotations, the choice of stiffness objective (potential energy or compliance), can be crucial for the optimal design concept. The paper considers topology optimization of hyperelastic bodies subjected simultaneously to external forces and prescribed non-zero displacements. In that respect it generalizes a recent contribution of ours to large deformations, but we note that the objectives of potential energy and compliance are no longer equivalent in the non-linear case. We use seven different hyperelastic strain energy functions and find that the numerical performance of the Kirchhoff-St.Venant model is in general significantly worse than the performance of the other six models, which are all modifications of this classical law that are equivalent in the limit of infinitesimal strains, but do not contain the well-known collapse in compression.

The first simulation issue is how to determine the particle-scale mechanical properties of a particle from the measured macroscopic mechanical properties of rocks.

Consequently, the probabilistic flood evaluation is expressed by probability boxes.

The convex relaxation yields a lower bound on the attainable performance. The optimal solution to the convex relaxation is used as a starting guess in a continuation approach where the convex relaxation is changed to a non-convex relaxation by introduction of a quadratic penalty constraint whereby intermediate-valued designs are prevented.

However, coupling of two different types of design variables, nodal coordinates and cross-sectional areas, often lead to slow convergence or even divergence. Because shape and sizing variables coupled increase the number of design variables and the changes of shape and sizing variables are of widely different orders of magnitude. Otherwise, multiple frequency constraints often cause difficult dynamic sensitivity analysis. Thus optimal criteria and mathematical programming methods have considerable limitations on solving the problems because of needing complex dynamic sensitivity analysis and being easily trapped into the local optima. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) show great potentials to solve the truss shape and sizing optimization problems. Since GAs adopt global probabilistic population search techniques and require no gradient information. The improved genetic algorithms can effectively increase the solution quality. However, the serial GA is computationally expensive and is limited on gaining higher quality solutions. To solve the truss shape and sizing optimization problems with frequency constraints more effectively and efficiently, a Niche Hybrid Parallel Genetic Algorithm (NHPGA) is proposed to significantly reduce the computational cost and to further improve solution quality. The NHPGA is to blend the advantages of parallel computing, simplex search and genetic algorithm with niche technique. Several typical truss optimization examples demonstrate that NHPGA can significantly reduce computing time and attain higher quality solutions. It also suggests that the NHPGA provide a potential algorithm architecture, which effectively combines the robust and global search characteristics of genetic algorithm, strong exploitation ability of simplex search and computational speedup property of parallel computing.",10.1007/s00158-010-0600-0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00158-010-0600-0

Sensitivity analyses indicate that for a given stream-aquifer system, the quality of the stream-aquifer test data can be improved through a careful selection of observation and pumping wells, as well as an appropriate test duration. An optimal location of an observation well is where the magnitude of the sensitivities is enhanced and the correlation of the transient sensitivities of two parameters is reduced. Generally, a longer pumping period will increase the sensitivity for l and K(x) and reduce the correlation between S(y) and K(x) and between S(y) and l.

The three skin parameters are hydraulic conductivity, specific storage, and thickness of the wellbore-skin zone, white the two aquifer parameters are hydraulic conductivity and specific storage of the formation zone. It is worthy to note although the thickness of the wellbore-skin zone is usually taken as an input data for the data-analyzed software, it is actually an unknown parameter that cannot be measured directly. This paper proposes a methodology for estimating the thickness of the wellbore-skin zone with other hydraulic parameters at the same time. Eight sets of well water-level. (WWL) data of aquifers with both positive and negative skins are generated by Moench and Hsieh [Moench and Hsieh, ] and four sets of standard normally distributed noise are then added to each set of WWL data. The results indicate that the negative-skin cases generally give a better estimated result than that of the positive-skin cases. Sensitivity analysis is also employed to demonstrate the physical behavior when slug test was performed under positive-skin effect. For the case of an aquifer with a positive-skin, the use of a longer series of WWL data for analysis is strongly recommended for better estimation of aquifer hydraulic conductivity.

Indeed, by means of global sensitivity analysis (GSA), modellers may identify both important (factor prioritisation) and non-influential (factor fixing) model factors. No general rule has yet been defined for verifying the convergence of the GSA methods. In order to fill this gap this paper presents a convergence analysis of three widely used GSA methods (SRC, Extended FAST and Morris screening) for an urban drainage stormwater quality-quantity model. After the convergence was achieved the results of each method were compared. In particular, a discussion on peculiarities, applicability, and reliability of the three methods is presented. Moreover, a graphical Venn diagram based classification scheme and a precise terminology for better identifying important, interacting and non-influential factors for each method is proposed. In terms of convergence, it was shown that sensitivity indices related to factors of the quantity model achieve convergence faster. Results for the Morris screening method deviated considerably from the other methods. Factors related to the quality model require a much higher number of simulations than the number suggested in literature for achieving convergence with this method. In fact, the results have shown that the term ""screening"" is improperly used as the method may exclude important factors from further analysis. Moreover, for the presented application the convergence analysis shows more stable sensitivity coefficients for the Extended-FAST method compared to SRC and Morris screening. Substantial agreement in terms of factor fixing was found between the Morris screening and Extended FAST methods. In general, the water quality related factors exhibited more important interactions than factors related to water quantity.

The methods entail global sensitivity analysis for retaining important PDD component functions, and a full- or sparse-grid dimension-reduction integration or quasi Monte Carlo simulation for estimating the PDD expansion coefficients. A unified algorithm, endowed with two distinct ranking schemes for grading component functions, was created for their numerical implementation. The fully adaptive-sparse PDD method is comprehensive and rigorous, leading to the second-moment statistics of a stochastic response that converges to the exact solution when the tolerances vanish. A partially adaptive-sparse PDD method, obtained through regulated adaptivity and sparsity, is economical and is, therefore, expected to solve practical problems with numerous variables. Compared with past developments, the adaptive-sparse PDD methods do not require their truncation parameter(s) to be assigned a priori or arbitrarily. The numerical results reveal that an adaptive-sparse PDD method achieves a desired level of accuracy with considerably fewer coefficients compared with existing PDD approximations. For a required accuracy in calculating the probabilistic response characteristics, the new bivariate adaptive-sparse PDD method is more efficient than the existing bivariately truncated PDD method by almost an order of magnitude.

These non-classical phenomena can be exploited, when using these fluids in Organic Rankine Cycles (ORCs), to increase isentropic efficiency. A predictive numerical simulation of these flows must account for two main sources of physical uncertainties: the BZT fluid properties often difficult to measure accurately and the usually fluctuating turbine inlet conditions. For taking full advantage of the BZT properties, the turbine geometry must also be specifically designed, keeping in mind the geometry achieved in practice after machining always slightly differs from the theoretical shape. This paper investigates some efficient procedures to perform shape optimization in a D BZT flow with multiple-source uncertainties (thermodynamic model, operating conditions and geometry). To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed efficient strategies for shape optimization in the presence of multiple-source uncertainties, a zero incidence symmetric airfoil wave-drag minimization problem is retained as a case-study. This simplified configuration encompasses most of the features associated with a turbine design problem, as far the uncertainty quantification is concerned.

While the traditional (first order) adjoint models give the gradient of the cost functional with respect to parameters, second order adjoint models give second derivative information in the form of products between the Hessian of the cost functional and a vector (representing a perturbation in sensitivity analysis, a search direction in optimization, an eigenvector, etc.).

Numerical examples illustrate the use of these computational tools in important applications like sensitivity analysis, optimization, uncertainty quantification and the calculation of directions of maximal error growth in three-dimensional atmospheric CTMs.",10.1016/j.jcp.2008.02.011,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2008.02.011

The well-known mesh dependent results are avoided by application of filter methods and mesh regularization strategies. Filter methods are successfully applied to SIMP (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) based topology optimization for many years. The filter method presented here uses a specific formulation that is based on convolution integrals. It is shown that the filter methods ensure mesh independency of the optimal designs. Furthermore they provide an easy and robust tool to explore the whole design space with respect to optimal designs with similar mechanical properties. A successful application of optimization strategies with FE-based parametrization requires the combination of filter methods with mesh regularization strategies. The latter ones ensure reliable results of the finite element solutions that are crucial for the sensitivity analysis. This presentation introduces a new mesh regularization strategy that is based on the Updated Reference Strategy (URS). It is shown that the methods formulated on this mechanical basis result in fast and robust mesh regularization methods.

The calculation of the derivatives of the most relevant quantities (displacements, stresses, strains) in optimum design of structures allows to estimate the structural response when changes in the design variables are introduced. This essential information is used by the most frequent conventional optimization algorithms (SLP, MMA, Feasible directions) in order to reach the optimal solution. According to this idea, the Sensitivity Analysis of the stress constraints in Topology Optimization problems is a crucial aspect to obtain the optimal solution when stress constraints are considered. Maximum stiffness approaches usually involve one linear constraint and one non-linear objective function. Thus, the computation of the required sensitivity analysis does not mean a crucial limitation. However, in the topology optimization problem with stress constraints, efficient and accurate computation of the derivatives is needed in order to reach appropriate optimal solutions. In this paper, a complete analytic and efficient procedure to obtain the Sensitivity Analysis of the stress constraints in topology optimization of continuum structures is analyzed. First order derivatives and second order directional derivatives of the stress constraints are analyzed and included in the optimization procedure. In addition, topology optimization problems usually involve thousands of design variables and constraints.

Our strategy is as follows: we suppose that the user defines an interest functional , which might depend on both the state variable and the parameters and which represents the goal of the computation. First, we propose an a posteriori error estimator which measures the error with respect to this functional. This error estimator is used in an adaptive algorithm to construct economic meshes by local mesh refinement.

With respect to model calibration, parameter estimation and analysis of uncertainty sources, various regression and probabilistic approaches have been used in different models calibrated for either daily or monthly time step. None of these applications however includes a comparison of uncertainty analysis in hydrological models with respect to the time periods, at which the models are operated. This study pursues a comprehensive inter-comparison and evaluation of uncertainty assessments by Bayesian revision using the Metropolis Hasting (MH) algorithm with the hydrological model WASMOD with daily and monthly time step. In the daily step model three likelihood functions are used in combination with Bayesian revision: (i) the AR () plus Normal time period independent model (Model ), (ii) the AR () plus Multi-Normal model (Model ), and (iii) the AR () plus Normal time period dependent model (Model ). In addition an index called the percentage of observations bracketed by the Unit Confidence Interval (PUCI) was used for uncertainty evaluation. The results reveal that it is more important to consider the autocorrelation in daily WASMOD rather than monthly WASMOD. Firstly, the resulting goodness of fit of the daily model vs. observations as measured by the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency value is comparable with that calculated by the optimization algorithm in monthly WASMOD. Secondly, the AR () model is not sufficiently adequate to estimate the distribution of residuals in daily WASMOD since PUCI shows that Model  outperforms Model . Furthermore, the maximum Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency value of Model  is the largest. Thirdly, Model  performs best over the entire flow range, while Model  outperforms Model  for high flows. This shows that additional statistical parameters reflect the statistical characters of the residuals more efficiently and accurately. Fourthly, by considering the difference in terms of application and computational efficiency it becomes evident that Model  performs best for daily WASMOD.

For this purpose a technique is proposed, using which the volume (or weight) of a structure can be minimized. The emphasis is on how one can define the shape precisely, and find a shape that accurately reflects the globally optimum shape. As desian constraints, stresses developed in the structure should not exceed the maximum allowable stress, and connectivity of the structure should not be lost during shape changes. Optimization is achieved by a stochastic search algorithm called direct simulated annealing (DSA), which seeks the global minimum through randomly generated configurations. In order to obtain random configurations, a boundary variation technique is used. In this technique, a set of key points is chosen and connected by cubic splines to describe the boundary of the structure. Whenever the positions of the key points are changed in random directions, a new shape is obtained. Thus, coordinates of the key points serve as design variables. In order to apply the optimization procedure, a general computer code was developed using ANSYS Parametric Design Language. A number of cases were examined to test its effectiveness.

A hyperelasticity-based elastoplastic material model is used for the constitutive relation that includes a large deformation effect. The contact condition between a workpiece and a rigid die is imposed through the penalty method with a modified Coulomb friction model. The domain of the workpiece is discretized by a meshfree method. A continuum-based DSA with respect to the rigid die shape parameter is formulated using a design velocity concept. The die shape perturbation has an effect on structural performance through the contact variational form. The effect of the deformation-dependent pressure load to the design sensitivity is discussed. It is shown that the design sensitivity equation uses the same tangent stiffness matrix as the response analysis. The linear design sensitivity equation is solved at each converged load step without the need of iteration, which is quite efficient in computation. The accuracy of sensitivity information is compared to that of the finite difference method with an excellent agreement.

The model uses well-known expressions for infiltration, evapotranspiration, and groundwater recharge to describe soil moisture dynamics at the local scale. Then, the spatial mean soil moisture is simulated by integrating the local behavior over a probability density function that characterizes the spatial variability of soil saturation. Ultimately, the model requires input of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET) time series and six parameters to simulate the dynamics of the spatial average soil moisture. The model is applied to the Fort Cobb watershed in Oklahoma using one year of data from September  through August . Model performance is evaluated in three main ways. First, the model's ability to reproduce observed local and spatial average soil moisture through calibration is examined. Second, the identifiability and stability of the parameter values are considered to assess uncertainty in the parameter values and errors in the model's mathematical structure. Third, a new method is developed that uses the sensitivities of soil moisture to precipitation and PET to assess the impacts of parameter uncertainty and structural errors on forecasts for unobserved conditions. At the local scale, the model reproduces the soil moisture with a similar degree of accuracy as a more physically-based model (HYDRUS  D), and both models exhibit some structural errors. The model can also be calibrated to approximately reproduce the spatial average soil moisture observations. However, the model produces a relatively wide range of plausible sensitivities and this range varies depending on the window of time from which the parameters are calibrated. This result implies that parameter uncertainty and model structural errors contribute substantially to model uncertainty for unobserved conditions.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.01.028,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.01.028

A design space is specified by the number of design variables, and the layout or configuration. To solve this type of design space problems, a simple initial design space is selected and gradually improved while the usual design variables are being optimized. To make the design space evolve into a better one, one may increase the number of design variables, but, in this transition, there are discontinuities in the objective and constraint functions. Accordingly, the sensitivity analysis methods based on continuity will not apply to this discontinuous stage. To overcome the difficulties, a numerical continuation scheme is proposed based on a new concept of a pivot phase design space.

A mathematical model for the prediction of the fluid pressure history is given by a time-dependent diffusion equation. Application of the finite-element method leads to systems of linear equations. A complication is that the underground consists of layers with very large contrasts in permeability. This implies that the symmetric and positive definite coefficient matrix has a very large condition number. Bad convergence behavior of the ICCG method has been observed, and a classical termination criterion is not valid in this problem. In [] we have shown that the number of small eigenvalues of the diagonally scaled matrix is equal to the number of high-permeability domains, which are not connected to a Dirichlet boundary. In this paper the proof is extended to an Incomplete Cholesky decomposition. To annihilate the bad effect of these small eigenvalues on the convergence. the Deflated ICCG method is used. In [] we have shown how to construct a deflation subspace for the case of a set of more or less parallel layers. That subspace proved to be a good approximation of the span of the ""small"" eigenvectors. As a result of this, the convergence Of DICCG is independent of the contrasts in the permeabilities.

Low Impact Development (LID) techniques have proven to be a viable and effective alternative by reducing stormwater runoff and increasing the infiltration and evapotranspiration capacity of urban areas. However, the lack of adequate modeling tools represents a barrier in designing and constructing such systems. This paper investigates the suitability of a mechanistic model, HYDRUS-D, to correctly describe the hydraulic behavior of permeable pavement installed at the University of Calabria. Two different scenarios of describing the hydraulic behavior of the permeable pavement system were analyzed: the first one uses a single porosity model for all layers of the permeable pavement; the second one uses a dual-porosity model for the base and sub-base layers. Measured and modeled month-long hydrographs were compared using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) index. A Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) followed by a Monte Carlo filtering highlighted the influence of the wear layer on the hydraulic behavior of the pavement and identified the ranges of parameters generating behavioral solutions. Reduced ranges were then used in the calibration procedure conducted with the metaheuristic Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for the estimation of hydraulic parameters. The best fit value for the first scenario was NSE = .; for the second scenario, it was NSE = ., indicating that the dual-porosity approach is more appropriate for describing the variably-saturated flow in the base and sub-base layers. Estimated parameters were validated using an independent, month-long set of measurements, resulting in NSE values of . and . for the first and second scenarios, respectively. The improvement in correspondence between measured and modeled hydrographs confirmed the reliability of the combination of GSA and PSO in dealing with highly dimensional optimization problems. Obtained results have demonstrated that PSO, due to its easiness of implementation and effectiveness, can represent a new and viable alternative to traditional optimization algorithms for the inverse estimation of unsaturated hydraulic properties. Finally, the results confirmed the suitability and the accuracy of HYDRUS-D in correctly describing the hydraulic behavior of permeable pavements.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.07.030,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.07.030

We present efficient and scalable algorithms for this end-to-end, data-to-prediction process under the Gaussian approximation and in the context of modeling the flow of the Antarctic ice sheet and its effect on loss of grounded ice to the ocean. The ice is modeled as a viscous, incompressible, creeping, shear-thinning fluid. The observational data come from satellite measurements of surface ice flow velocity, and the uncertain parameter field to be inferred is the basal sliding parameter, represented by a heterogeneous coefficient in a Robin boundary condition at the base of the ice sheet. The prediction quantity of interest is the present-day ice mass flux from the Antarctic continent to the ocean. We show that the work required for executing this data-to-prediction process-measured in number of forward (and adjoint) ice sheet model solves-is independent of the state dimension, parameter dimension, data dimension, and the number of processor cores. The key to achieving this dimension independence is to exploit the fact that, despite their large size, the observational data typically provide only sparse information on model parameters.

The next challenge is to bridge the gap between deterministic optimization techniques and the industrial need for robustness. This paper introduces a generally applicable strategy for modeling and efficiently solving robust optimization problems based on time consuming simulations. Noise variables and their effect on the responses are taken into account explicitly. The robust optimization strategy consists of four main stages: modeling, sensitivity analysis, robust optimization and sequential robust optimization. Use is made of a metamodel-based optimization approach to couple the computationally expensive finite element simulations with the robust optimization procedure. The initial metamodel approximation will only serve to find a first estimate of the robust optimum. Sequential optimization steps are subsequently applied to efficiently increase the accuracy of the response prediction at regions of interest containing the optimal robust design. The applicability of the proposed robust optimization strategy is demonstrated by the sequential robust optimization of an analytical test function and an industrial V-bending process. For the industrial application, several production trial runs have been performed to investigate and validate the robustness of the production process. For both applications, it is shown that the robust optimization strategy accounts for the effect of different sources of uncertainty onto the process responses in a very efficient manner.

The solution of this type of problems requires a large number of finite element model re-analyses to be performed over the space of system parameters. A component mode synthesis technique is implemented to carry out the sensitivity analysis in a reduced space of generalized coordinates. The reliability sensitivity analysis is performed by an approach based on a simple post-processing of an advanced sampling-based reliability analysis.

Using this DNS capability, we investigate the macroscale response of polycrystalline microstructures and the accuracy of homogenization theory for upscaling the microscale response. Using a massively parallel finite-element code, we perform an ensemble of direct numerical simulations in which polycrystalline microstructures are embedded throughout a macroscale structure.

First, the boundary of structure is implicitly represented as the zero level set of a higher-dimensional level set function, and the implicit surface is parameterized through the interpolation of a given set of compactly supported radial basis functions. In this way, the original Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation is transformed into a system of algebraic equations. Correspondingly, the topological shape optimization is changed to the easiest size optimization in structural optimization. Many more efficient gradient-based optimization algorithms can be directly applied to the size optimization. Second, to save the expensive computational cost in the D large-scale optimization problems, the discrete wavelet transform is introduced into the level set method to compress the size of the coefficient matrix in compactly supported radial basis function interpolant. The discrete wavelet transform converts the original matrix into a set of wavelet basis and therefore eliminates the ""noise"" elements in the new matrix, so that the linear system can be replaced by a sparser one. Finally, a cross section projection strategy is utilized to ensure the satisfaction of the extrusion constraint and reduce the number of the design variables, simultaneously.

This study develops a topological design method of surface electrode distribution over piezoelectric sensors/actuators attached to a thin-walled shell structure for reducing the sound radiation in an unbounded acoustic domain. In the optimization model, the sound pressure norm at specific reference points under excitations at a certain excitation frequency or in a given frequency range is taken as the objective function. The pseudo densities for indicating absence and presence of surface electrodes at each element are taken as the design variables, and a penalized relationship between the densities and the active damping effect is employed. The vibrating structure is discretized with finite element model for the frequency response analysis and the sound radiation analysis in the unbounded acoustic domain is treated by boundary element method. The applied voltage on each actuator is determined by the constant gain velocity feedback (CGVF) control law. The technique of the complex mode superposition in the state space, in conjunction with a model reduction transformation, is adopted in the response analysis of the system characterized by a non-proportional active damping property.

The focus of the study is firmly on PMP estimates derived through meteorological analyses and not on statistically derived PMPs. Theoretical PMP cannot be computed directly and operational PMP estimates are developed through a stepwise procedure using a significant degree of subjective professional judgment. This paper presents a methodology for portraying the uncertain nature of PMP estimation by analyzing individual steps within the PMP derivation procedure whereby for each parameter requiring judgment, a set of possible values is specified and accompanied by expected probabilities. The resulting range of possible PMP values can be compared with the previously derived operational single-value PMP, providing measures of the conservatism and variability of the original estimate. To our knowledge, this is the first uncertainty analysis conducted for a PMP derived through meteorological analyses. The methodology was tested on the La Joie Dam watershed in British Columbia. The results indicate that the commonly used single-value PMP estimate could be more than % higher when possible changes in various meteorological variables used to derive the PMP are considered. The findings of this study imply that PMP estimates should always be characterized as a range of values recognizing the significant uncertainties involved in PMP estimation.

"Jakeman, JD | Narayan, A | Xiu, DB",2013,Minimal multi-element stochastic collocation for uncertainty quantification of discontinuous functions,Applications_JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS,18,3.6,"We propose a multi-element stochastic collocation method that can be applied in high-dimensional parameter space for functions with discontinuities lying along manifolds of general geometries. The key feature of the method is that the parameter space is decomposed into multiple elements defined by the discontinuities and thus only the minimal number of elements are utilized. On each of the resulting elements the function is smooth and can be approximated using high-order methods with fast convergence properties. The decomposition strategy is in direct contrast to the traditional multi-element approaches which define the sub-domains by repeated splitting of the axes in the parameter space. Such methods are more prone to the curse-of-dimensionality because of the fast growth of the number of elements caused by the axis based splitting. The present method is a two-step approach. Firstly a discontinuity detector is used to partition parameter space into disjoint elements in each of which the function is smooth. The detector uses an efficient combination of the high-order polynomial annihilation technique along with adaptive sparse grids, and this allows resolution of general discontinuities with a smaller number of points when the discontinuity manifold is low-dimensional. After partitioning, an adaptive technique based on the least orthogonal interpolant is used to construct a generalized Polynomial Chaos surrogate on each element. The adaptive technique reuses all information from the partitioning and is variance-suppressing. We present numerous numerical examples that illustrate the accuracy, efficiency, and generality of the method. When compared against standard locally-adaptive sparse grid methods, the present method uses many fewer number of collocation samples and is more accurate.",10.1016/j.jcp.2013.02.035,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2013.02.035

Parameters governing water flow in the macropores were shown to be sensitive in a screening analysis with the Morris method and the uncertainty in these parameters was also reduced by PIMLI.

We performed sensitivity analyses to assess how much, about what and where this information can be best obtained. It is well known that the response to harmonic fluctuations (and many harmonics can be superimposed to describe sea-level fluctuations) decreases exponentially with distance inland. The characteristic length of this decay is L(c) = root DP/pi, where D is hydraulic diffusivity and P is period. Maximum sensitivity is obtained for distances equal to L. which is where maximum information would be obtained if the aquifer is treated as homogeneous. However, sensitivity depends not only on the problem dynamics, but also on parameterization. In fact, if heterogeneity is acknowledged by finely discretizing hydraulic conductivity, we find that connection to the sea (i.e. K near the coast) is what can be characterized best, while the most informative measurements are located at around . L(c). Thin low conductivity zones near the coast lead to a stepwise decrease in the amplitude of groundwater head fluctuations.

In the conventional level set-based topology optimization, the optimum topology strongly depends on the initial level set due to the incapability of inner-front creation during the optimization process. In the present work, in this regard, an algorithm for inner-front creation is proposed in which the sizes, the positions, and the number of new inner-fronts during the optimization process can be globally and consistently identified. In the algorithm, the criterion of inner-front creation for compliance minimization problems of linear elastic structures is chosen as the strain energy density along with volumetric constraint. To facilitate the inner-front creation process, the inner-front creation map is constructed and used to define new level set function. In the implementation of inner-front creation algorithm, to suppress the numerical oscillation of solutions due to the sharp edges in the level set function, domain regularization is carried out by solving the edge smoothing partial differential equation (smoothing PDE). To update the level set function during the optimization process, the least-squares finite element method (LSFEM) is adopted. Through the LSFEM, a symmetric positive definite system matrix is constructed, and non-diffused and non-oscillatory solution for the hyperbolic PDE such as level set equation can be obtained.

The proposed methodology improves the algorithm of aPC and extends the method, that was previously only introduced as tensor product expansion, to moderately high-dimensional stochastic problems. The fundamental idea of aPC is to use the statistical moments of the input random variables to develop the polynomial chaos expansion. This approach provides the possibility to propagate continuous or discrete probability density functions and also histograms (data sets) as long as their moments exist, are finite and the determinant of the moment matrix is strictly positive. For cases with limited data availability, this approach avoids bias and fitting errors caused by wrong assumptions. In this work, an alternative way to calculate the aPC is suggested, which provides the optimal polynomials, Gaussian quadrature collocation points and weights from the moments using only a handful of matrix operations on the Hankel matrix of moments. It can therefore be implemented without requiring prior knowledge about statistical data analysis or a detailed understanding of the mathematics of polynomial chaos expansions. The extension to more input variables suggested in this work, is an anisotropic and adaptive version of Smolyak's algorithm that is solely based on the moments of the input probability distributions. It is referred to as SAMBA (PC), which is short for Sparse Approximation of Moment-Based Arbitrary Polynomial Chaos. It is illustrated that for moderately high-dimensional problems (up to  different input variables or histograms) SAMBA can significantly simplify the calculation of sparse Gaussian quadrature rules.

The main idea is to extract the optimal orthogonal basis via inexpensive calculations on a coarse mesh and then use them for the fine-scale analysis. To validate the developed reduced-order model, the method is implemented to: () the stochastic steady-state heat diffusion in a square slab; () the incompressible, two-dimensional laminar boundary-layer over a flat plate with uncertainties in free-stream velocity and physical properties; and () the highly nonlinear Ackley function with uncertain coefficients. For the heat diffusion problem, the thermal conductivity of the slab is assumed to be a stochastic field with known exponential covariance function and approximated via the Karhunen-Loeve expansion. In all three test cases, the input random parameters are assumed to be uniformly distributed, and a polynomial chaos expansion is found using the regression method. The Sobol's quasi-random sequence is used to generate the sample points. The numerical results of the three test cases show that the non-intrusive model reduction scheme is able to produce satisfactory results for the statistical quantities of interest. It is found that the developed non-intrusive model reduction scheme is computationally more efficient than the classical polynomial chaos expansion for uncertainty quantification of stochastic problems. The performance of the developed scheme becomes more apparent for the problems with larger stochastic dimensions and those requiring higher polynomial order for the stochastic discretization.",10.1002/nme.4900,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nme.4900
"Yang, RZ | Du, JB",2013,Microstructural topology optimization with respect to sound power radiation,Applications_STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION,16,3.2,The paper deals with the problem of topological design of microstructure with respect to minimization of the sound power radiation from a vibrating macrostructure. The macrostructure is excited at a single or a band of excitation frequencies by a time-harmonic mechanical loading with prescribed amplitude and spatial distribution. The structural damping is considered to be proportional damping. The sound power is calculated using a high frequency approximation formulation and thus the sensitivity analysis may be performed in a very efficient manner. The microstructure composed of two different solid isotropic materials is assumed to be identical from point to point at the macro-level which implies that the interface between the structure and the acoustic medium is unchanged during the design process. The equivalent material properties of the macrostructure are calculated using homogenization method and the bi-material SIMP model is employed to achieve zero-one design at the micro-scale. Numerical examples are given to validate the model developed. Some interesting features of acoustic microstructure topology optimization are revealed and discussed.,10.1007/s00158-012-0838-9,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00158-012-0838-9

For ensemble forecasting, ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is an appealing candidate for familiarity and relative simplicity. EnKF, however, is optimal in the second-order sense, only if the observation equation is linear. As such, without an iterative approach, EnKF may not be appropriate for assimilating streamflow data for updating soil moisture states due to the strong nonlinear relationships between the two. Maximum likelihood ensemble filter (MLEF), on the other hand, is not subject to the above limitation. Being an ensemble extension of variational assimilation (VAR), MLEF also offers a strong connection with the traditional single-valued forecast process through the control, or the maximum likelihood, solution. In this work, we apply MLEF and EnKF as a fixed lag smoother to the Sacramento (SAC) soil moisture accounting model and unit hydrograph (UH) for assimilation of streamflow, mean areal precipitation (MAP) and potential evaporation (MAPE) data for updating soil moisture states. For comparative evaluation, three experiments were carried out. Comparison between homoscedastic vs. heteroscedastic modeling of selected statistical parameters for DA indicates that heteroscedastic modeling does not improve over homoscedastic modeling, and that homoscedastic error modeling with sensitivity analysis may suffice for application of MLEF for soil moisture updating using streamflow data. Comparative evaluation with respect to the model errors associated with soil moisture dynamics, the ensemble size and the number of streamflow observations assimilated per cycle showed that, in general, MLEF outperformed EnKF under varying conditions of observation and model errors, and ensemble size, and that MLEF performed well with an ensemble size as small as  while EnKF required a much larger ensemble size to perform closely to MLEF. Also, MLEF was not very sensitive to the uncertainty parameters and performed reasonably well over relatively wide ranges of parameter settings, an attribute desirable for operational applications where accurate estimation of such parameters is often difficult.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.06.052,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.06.052
"McElwee, CD",2002,Improving the analysis of slug tests,Applications_JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,16,1.0,"This paper examines several. techniques that have the potential to improve the quality of slug test analysis. These techniques are applicable in the range from low hydraulic conductivities with overdamped responses to high hydraulic conductivities with nonlinear oscillatory responses. Four techniques for improving slug test analysis will be discussed: use of an extended capability nonlinear model, sensitivity analysis, correction for acceleration and velocity effects, and use of multiple slug tests. The four-parameter nonlinear slug test model used in this work is shown to allow accurate analysis of slug tests with widely differing character. The parameter beta represents a correction to the water column length caused primarily by radius variations in the wellbore and is most useful in matching the oscillation frequency and amplitude. The water column velocity at slug initiation (V-) is an additional model parameter, which would ideally be zero but may not be due to the initiation mechanism. The remaining two model parameters are A (parameter for nonlinear effects) and K (hydraulic conductivity). Sensitivity analysis shows that in general beta and V- have the lowest sensitivity and K usually has the highest. However, for very high K values the sensitivity to A may surpass the sensitivity to K. Oscillatory slug tests involve higher accelerations and velocities of the water column; thus, the pressure transducer responses are affected by these factors and the model response must be corrected to allow maximum accuracy for the analysis. The performance of multiple slug tests will allow some statistical measure of the experimental accuracy and of the reliability of the resulting aquifer parameters.",10.1016/S0022-1694(02)00214-7,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0022-1694(02)00214-7

Here, we employ synergistically stochastic simulations and second-order stochastic perturbation analysis to study supersonic flow past a wedge with random rough surface. The roughness (of length d) starting at the wedge apex is modeled as stochastic process (with zero mean and correlation length A) obtained from a new stochastic differential equation. A multi-element probabilistic collocation method (ME-PCM) on sparse grids is employed to solve the stochastic Euler equations while a WENO scheme is used to discretize the equations in two spatial dimensions. The perturbation analysis is used to verify the stochastic simulations and to provide insight for small values of A, where stochastic simulations become prohibitively expensive. We show that the random roughness enhances the lift and drag forces on the wedge beyond the rough region, and this enhancement is proportional to (d/A)(). The effects become more pronounced as the Mach number increases.

While the non-equilibrium convection dispersion equation model may match the data well, uncertainty in parameter estimates is often large. In this work we investigate approaches to improve match for the equilibrium model and reduce parameter estimate uncertainty for the non-equilibrium model. Four column experiment data sets are selected from the literature for the illustration. For the equilibrium convection dispersion equation model, we show that measurement error, presence of immobile water, and other mechanisms can cause mismatch between model predictions and observations because the model is sensitive to water content. The mismatch may be overcome by calibrating the effective water content. For the non-equilibrium convection dispersion equation model, simultaneous fitting of multiple tracers with reduced number of calibration parameters (e.g., assuming the dispersivity and mobile water fraction to be identical for different tracers, the mass transfer coefficient to be proportional to tracer molecular diffusion coefficient) can reduce the uncertainty in parameter estimate and better identify/quantify the non-equilibrium processes. By evaluating and comparing the multiple estimates obtained with different choices of calibration parameters (e.g., fixing or estimating water content), parameterizations and models (e.g., equilibrium or non-equilibrium), the reliability of the data interpretation can be improved by quantifying uncertainty in the experiment, considering alternative transport processes, and following the principle of parsimony.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.07.063,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.07.063

Dynamic loads have been considered only in small-scale problems. Recently, an algorithm for dynamic response optimization using transformation of dynamic loads into equivalent static loads has been proposed. The transformation is conducted to match the displacement fields from dynamic and static analyses. This algorithm can be applied to large-scale problems. However, the application has been limited to size optimization. The present study applies the algorithm to shape optimization. Because the number of degrees of freedom of finite element models is usually very large in shape optimization, it is difficult to conduct dynamic response optimization with conventional methods that directly treat dynamic response in the time domain. The optimization process is carried out by interfacing an optimization system and an analysis system for structural dynamics. Various examples are solved to verify the algorithm.

It is important to extend the higher degree interpolation in the smooth regions up to a thin layer of linear elements that contain the discontinuity to maintain a highly accurate solution. This is achieved here by introducing Essentially Non-Oscillatory (ENO) type stencil selection into the Simplex Stochastic Collocation (SSC) method. For each simplex in the discretization of the parametric space, the stencil with the highest polynomial degree is selected from the set of candidate stencils to construct the local response surface approximation. The application of the resulting SSC-ENO method to a discontinuous test function shows a sharper resolution of the jumps and a higher order approximation of the percentiles near the singularity.

A body-like design element makes possible to unify the shape optimization of both pure shells and truss-stiffened shell structures. The scalar field of the design element is obtained by attaching to each control point a scalar quantity, which is an add-on to the position and weight of the control point. This scalar field is linked to the shell thickness distribution, which can be optimized simultaneously with the shape of the shell. For linear and non-linear analysis of shell structures, a reliable -node shell finite element formulation is utilized.

First, considering the composite-scaled sensitivity (CSS) jointly with parameter correlation coefficients (PCC) in a CSS/PCC analysis addresses the difficulties with CSS mentioned in the introduction. Second, their new parameter identifiability statistic actually is likely to do a poor job of parameter identifiability in common situations.

However, their widespread adoption has been limited by their computational cost. In this view, surrogate modeling is focused on developing and using a computationally inexpensive surrogate of the original model. While having been previously applied to various water-related and environmental modeling problems, no studies have used surrogate models for the analysis of LIDs. The aim of this research thus was to investigate the benefit of surrogate-based modeling in the numerical analysis of LIDs.

Error models were developed to disturb the measured input and calibration data to reflect common systematic and random uncertainties found in these types of datasets. A Bayesian approach was used for model sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. It was found that random errors in measured data had minor impact on the model performance and sensitivity. In general, systematic errors in input and calibration data impacted the parameter distributions (e.g. changed their shapes and location of peaks). In most of the systematic error scenarios (especially those where uncertainty in input and calibration data was represented using 'best-case' assumptions), the errors in measured data were fully compensated by the parameters.

However, for thermoelastic structures this is not the case and a maximum volume may not be an active constraint for minimum compliance. This is proved for thermoelastic structures by sensitivity analysis of compliance that facilitates localized determination of sensitivities, and the compliance is not identical to the total elastic energy (twice strain energy). An explicit formula for the difference is derived and numerically illustrated with examples. In compliance minimization for thermoelastic structures it may be advantageous to decrease the total volume, but for strength maximization it is argued to keep the total permissible volume.

Recently, a new direction of research is considering the high-speed torpedo, which is capable of reaching up to  mph underwater. When a torpedo travels at this speed, the flow around the body separates and a cavity is formed. This cavity generation due to high speeds is called supercavitation. And the drag force acting on this supercavitating torpedo dictates the thrust requirements for the propulsion system, to maintain a required cavity at the operating speed. Therefore, any reduction in the drag force, obtained by modifying the shape of the cavitator or the nose of the torpedo, would result in lower propulsion requirements. In this work, shape optimization techniques were employed to determine the optimum ( minimum-drag) shape of the cavitator given certain operating conditions.

Our aim is to obtain a single, unified, compact expression to compute arbitrarily high order directional derivatives, independent of the dimension of the material coordinates system and of the dimension of the elements. Special care has been taken on giving the final results in terms of easy-to-compute expressions, and special emphasis has been made in holding recurrence and simplicity of intermediate operations. The proposed scheme does not depend on any particular form of the state equations, and can be applied to both, direct and adjoint state formulations. Thus, its numerical implementation in standard engineering codes should be considered as a straightforward process. As an example, a second order sensitivity analysis is applied to the solution of a D shape design optimization problem.",10.1016/S0045-7825(99)00355-2,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0045-7825(99)00355-2

This paper presents a new computational tool for predicting reliability (failure probability) and reliabilitysensitivity of mechanical or structural systems subject to random uncertainties in loads, material properties, and geometry. The dimension reduction method is applied to compute response moments and their sensitivities with respect to the distribution parameters (e.g., shape and scale parameters, mean, and standard deviation) of basic random variables. Saddlepoint approximations with truncated cumulant generating functions are employed to estimate failure probability, probability density functions, and cumulative distribution functions. The rigorous analytic derivation of the parameter sensitivities of the failure probability with respect to the distribution parameters of basic random variables is derived.

Illustrative application to a paradigm particle diffusion problem,Applications_JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS,14,4.67,"This work presents an illustrative application of the second-order adjoint sensitivity analysis methodology(nd-ASAM) to a paradigm neutron diffusion problem, which is sufficiently simple to admit an exact solution, thereby making transparent the underlying mathematical derivations. The general theory underlying nd-ASAM indicates that, for a physical system comprising N-alpha parameters, the computation of all of the first-and second-order response sensitivities requires (per response) at most (N(alpha) + )""large-scale"" computations using the first-level and, respectively, second-level adjoint sensitivity systems(st-LASS and nd-LASS). Very importantly, however, the illustrative application presented in this work shows that the actual number of adjoint computations needed for computing all of the first-and second-order response sensitivities may be significantly less than (N(alpha) + ) per response. For this illustrative problem, four ""large-scale"" adjoint computations sufficed for the complete and exact computations of all  first-and  distinct second-order derivatives. Furthermore, the construction and solution of the nd-LASS requires very little additional effort beyond the construction of the adjoint sensitivity system needed for computing the first-order sensitivities. Very significantly, only the sources on the right-sides of the diffusion (differential) operator needed to be modified; the left-side of the differential equations (and hence the ""solver"" in large-scale practical applications) remained unchanged. All of the first-order relative response sensitivities to the model parameters have significantly large values, of order unity. Also importantly, most of the second-order relative sensitivities are just as large, and some even up to twice as large as the first-order sensitivities. In the illustrative example presented in this work, the second-order sensitivities contribute little to the response variances and covariances. However, they have the following major impacts on the computed moments of the response distribution: (a) they cause the ""expected value of the response"" to differ from the ""computed nominal value of the response""; and (b) they contribute decisively to causing asymmetries in the response distribution. Indeed, neglecting the second-order sensitivities would nullify the third-order response correlations, and hence would nullify the skewness of the response. Consequently, any events occurring in a response's long and/or short tails, which are characteristic of rare but decisive events (e. g., major accidents, catastrophes), would likely be missed. The nd-ASAM is expected to affect significantly other fields that need efficiently computed order response sensitivities, e.g., optimization, data assimilation/adjustment, model calibration, and predictive modeling.",10.1016/j.jcp.2014.11.030,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2014.11.030

Therefore, the contribution of the paper is twofold.

The results confirm the importance of the riparian zone in controlling the short-term (daily) streamwater nitrogen dynamics in this catchment but not the overall flux of nitrogen from the catchment. It was also shown that as the complexity of a hydrological model increases over-parameterisation occurs, but the converse is true for a water quality model where additional process representation leads to additional acceptable model simulations.

To date, standard groundwater flow simulators have mostly been used to assess the impact of this extraction on regional groundwater systems. Recent research has demonstrated that predictions of regional impact assessment made by such models may be seriously compromised unless account is taken of the presence of a gas phase near extraction wells. At the same time, CBM impact assessment must accommodate the traditional requirements of regional groundwater modelling. These include representation of surficial groundwater processes and up-scaled rock properties as well as the need for calibration and predictive uncertainty quantification. The study documented herein () quantifies errors in regional drawdown predictions incurred through neglect of the presence of a gas phase near CBM extraction centres, and () evaluates the extent to which these errors can be mitigated by simulating near-well desaturation using a modified Richards equation formulation within a standard groundwater flow simulator. Two synthetic examples are provided to quantify the impact of the gas phase and verify the proposed modelling approach (implemented in MODFLOW-USG) against rigorous multiphase flow simulations (undertaken using ECLIPSE*). ECLIPSE simulations demonstrate convergence towards a time-asymptotic relationship between water saturation and pressure. This relationship can be approximated using a slightly modified van Genuchten function. Where this function is employed in combination with the modified Richards equation strategy to accommodate near-well desaturation, errors in predicted drawdown are reduced significantly, including in cases where complexities such as sloping coal layers are introduced to the model domain (the latter promoting buoyancy-driven movement of gas). Sensitivity analyses further indicate that only the general properties of the employed desaturation function need to be respected to significantly reduce errors in regional drawdown predictions that would arise if the presence of the near-well gas phase was ignored. These properties can be inferred from reservoir properties and from the outcomes of reservoir model simulations that are available at local CBM operation sites.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.02.012,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.02.012

However, the conventional global sensitivity indices are defined with consideration of only parametric uncertainty. Based on a hierarchical structure of parameter, model, and scenario uncertainties and on recently developed techniques of model- and scenario-averaging, this study derives new global sensitivity indices for multiple models and multiple scenarios. To reduce computational cost of variance-based global sensitivity analysis, sparse grid collocation method is used to evaluate the mean and variance terms involved in the variance-based global sensitivity analysis. In a simple synthetic case of groundwater flow and reactive transport, it is demonstrated that the global sensitivity indices vary substantially between the four models and three scenarios. Not considering the model and scenario uncertainties, might result in biased identification of important model parameters. This problem is resolved by using the new indices defined for multiple models and/or multiple scenarios. This is particularly true when the sensitivity indices and model/scenario probabilities vary substantially. The sparse grid collocation method dramatically reduces the computational cost, in comparison with the popular quasi-random sampling method.

Compared to the standard ANOVA with mutually orthogonal component functions, the anchored ANOVA, with an arbitrary choice of the anchor point, loses the orthogonality if employing the same measure. However, an advantage of the anchored ANOVA consists in the considerably reduced number of deterministic solver's computations, which renders the uncertainty quantification of real engineering problems much easier. Different from existing methods, the covariance decomposition of the output variance is used in this work to take account of the interactions between non-orthogonal components, yielding an exact variance expansion and thus, with a suitable numerical integration method, provides a strategy that converges. This convergence is verified by studying academic tests. In particular, the sensitivity problem of existing methods to the choice of anchor point is analyzed via the Ishigami case, and we point out that covariance decomposition survives from this issue. Also, with a truncated anchored ANOVA expansion, numerical results prove that the proposed approach is less sensitive to the anchor point. The covariance-based sensitivity indices (SI) are also used, compared to the variance-based SI. Furthermore, we emphasize that the covariance decomposition can be generalized in a straightforward way to decompose higher-order moments.

Besides traditional, already well developed methods - such as first order perturbation theory or Monte Carlo sampling - Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) has been given a growing emphasis in recent years due to its simple application and good performance. This paper presents new developments of the research done at TU Delft on such Polynomial Chaos (PC) techniques. Our work is focused on the Non-Intrusive Spectral Projection (NISP) approach and adaptive methods for building the PCE of responses of interest. Recent efforts resulted in a new adaptive sparse grid algorithm designed for estimating the PC coefficients. The algorithm is based on Gerstner's procedure for calculating multidimensional integrals but proves to be computationally significantly cheaper, while at the same it retains a similar accuracy as the original method. More importantly the issue of basis adaptivity has been investigated and two techniques have been implemented for constructing the sparse PCE of quantities of interest. Not using the traditional full PC basis set leads to further reduction in computational time since the high order grids necessary for accurately estimating the near zero expansion coefficients of polynomial basis vectors not needed in the PCE can be excluded from the calculation. Moreover the sparse PC representation of the response is easier to handle when used for sensitivity analysis or uncertainty propagation due to the smaller number of basis vectors. The developed grid and basis adaptive methods have been implemented in Matlab as the Fully Adaptive Non-Intrusive Spectral Projection (FANISP) algorithm and were tested on four analytical problems. These show consistent good performance both in terms of the accuracy of the resulting PC representation of quantities and the computational costs associated with constructing the sparse PCE. Basis adaptivity also seems to make the employment of PC techniques possible for problems with a higher number of input parameters (-), alleviating a well known limitation of the traditional approach.

Classically, this derivative comes from the second term of the topological asymptotic expansion, dealing only with infinitesimal perturbations. However, for practical applications, we need to insert perturbations of finite size. Therefore, we consider one more term in the expansion which is defined as the second order topological derivative. In order to present these ideas, in this work we calculate first as well as second order topological derivatives for the total potential energy associated to the Laplace's equation, when the domain is perturbed with a hole. Furthermore, we also study the effects of different boundary conditions on the hole: Neumann and Dirichlet (both homogeneous). In the Neumann's case, the second order topological derivative depends explicitly on higher-order gradients of the state solution and also implicitly on the point where the hole is nucleated through the solution of an auxiliary problem. On the other hand, in the Dirichlet's case, the first order topological derivative depends explicitly on the state solution as well as implicitly through the solution of an auxiliary problem, and the second order topological derivative depends only explicitly on the solution associated to the original problem.

This approach combines the capabilities of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and the probabilistic collocation method (PCM) to provide a better treatment of uncertainties in hydrologic models. The EnKF method would be employed to approximate the posterior probabilities of model parameters and improve the forecasting accuracy based on the observed measurements; the PCM approach is proposed to construct a model response surface in terms of the posterior probabilities of model parameters to reveal uncertainty propagation from model parameters to model outputs. The proposed method is applied to the Xiangxi River, located in the Three Gorges Reservoir area of China. The results indicate that the proposed EFPC approach can effectively quantify the uncertainty of hydrologic models.

In this function, the transient responses at the midpoints of the uncertain parameters can be obtained directly through the HNM. A sensitivity analysis technique is suggested to calculate the first derivative of the transient responses with respect to each uncertain parameter based on two cases that the parameter exists in load or material property.

The equations for structural analysis are often composed of the stiffness part and the applied loading part. The shape sensitivity formulations for the stiffness part were well-developed in the literature, but not for the loading part, especially for body forces and surface tractions. The applied loads are often assumed to be conservative or design-independent. In shape design problems, however, the applied loads are often functions of design variables. In this paper, shape sensitivity formulations are presented when the body forces and surface tractions depend on shape design variables. Especially, the continuum-discrete (C-D) and discrete-discrete (D-D) approaches are compared in detail. It is shown that the two methods are theoretically and numerically equivalent when the same discretization, numerical integration, and linear design velocity fields are used. The accuracy of sensitivity calculation is demonstrated using a cantilevered beam under uniform pressure and an arch dam crown cantilever under gravity and hydrostatic loading at the upstream face of the structure.

Assuming that an accurate surrogate model is available, the proposed method first searches the worst combination of interval variables for constraints when only interval variables are present or for probabilistic constraints when both interval and random variables are present. Due to the fact that the worst combination of interval variables for probability of failure does not always coincide with that for a performance function, the proposed method directly uses the probability of failure to obtain the worst combination of interval variables when both interval and random variables are present. To calculate sensitivities of the constraints and probabilistic constraints with respect to interval variables by the sampling-based method, behavior of interval variables at the worst case is defined by the Dirac delta function. Then, Monte Carlo simulation is applied to calculate the constraints and probabilistic constraints with the worst combination of interval variables, and their sensitivities. A merit of using an MCS-based approach in the X-space is that it does not require gradients of performance functions and transformation from X-space to U-space for reliability analysis, thus there is no approximation or restriction in calculating sensitivities of constraints or probabilistic constraints.

To resolve these problems, this study analyzed different levels of uncertainty in a hierarchical way, and used the maximum likelihood version of BMA, i.e., MLBMA, to improve the computational efficiency. This study demonstrates the applicability of MLBMA to groundwater reactive transport modeling in a synthetic case in which twenty-seven reactive transport models were designed to predict the reactive transport of hexavalent uranium (U(VI)) based on observations at a former uranium mill site near Naturita, CO. These reactive transport models contain three uncertain model components, i.e., parameterization of hydraulic conductivity, configuration of model boundary, and surface complexation reactions that simulate U(VI) adsorption. These uncertain model components were aggregated into the alternative models by integrating a hierarchical structure into MLBMA. The modeling results of the individual models and MLBMA were analyzed to investigate their predictive performance. The predictive logscore results show that MLBMA generally outperforms the best model, suggesting that using MLBMA is a sound strategy to achieve more robust model predictions relative to a single model. MLBMA works best when the alternative models are structurally distinct and have diverse model predictions. When correlation in model structure exists, two strategies were used to improve predictive performance by retaining structurally distinct models or assigning smaller prior model probabilities to correlated models. Since the synthetic models were designed using data from the Naturita site, the results of this study are expected to provide guidance for real-world modeling.

The linear uncertainty analysis is approximate for this nonlinear system, but it provides some measure of uncertainty for computationally demanding models.

The flow in the horizontal direction was assumed to be non-Darcian, while the flow in the vertical direction was assumed to be Darcian. The Izbash equation was employed to describe the non-Darcian flow in the horizontal direction of the aquifer. We used a linearization procedure to approximate the non-linear term in the governing equation enabling the mathematical model to be solved using a combination of Laplace and Fourier cosine transforms. Approximate analytical solutions for the drawdown were obtained and the impacts of different parameters on the drawdown were analyzed. The results indicated that a larger power index n in the Izbash equation leads to a larger drawdown at early times, while a larger n results in a smaller drawdown at late times. The drawdowns along the vertical direction z are symmetric if the well screen is located in the center of the aquifer, and the drawdown at the center of the aquifer is the largest along the vertical direction for this case. The length of the well screen w has little impact on the drawdown at early times, while a larger length of the well screen results in a smaller drawdown at late times. The drawdown increases with K-r at early times, while it decreases as K-r increases at late times, in which K-r is the apparent radial hydraulic conductivity.

The pulse model of electrolyte tracer advanced by Lei et al. () indicated that the boundary condition is critical for accurate velocity measurement. To improve the measurement accuracy, Lei et al. () improved the method by employing practically measured boundary condition instead of the pulse assumption, by an additional sensor close to the electrolyte injection location. The measurement precision was improved significantly as compared with that by the pulse model. However, the measured boundary condition is not the actual boundary condition, which may still cause errors in the measured velocities. The sensor for boundary measurement can otherwise be used to measure flow velocity if it can be rationally determined without measurement. In this study, modifications are made to the previous methods. The boundary condition is not measured by an additional sensor but is determined by fitting the model to the experimental data so as to determine virtual/real boundary condition (Virtual B.C.) at its actual position and the flow velocity simultaneously. The measured velocities and the estimated boundary condition are verified using the experimentally measured data involved three flow rates (,  and  L min(-)), three slope gradients ( degrees,  degrees and  degrees) and six measurement positions (., ., ., ., ., and . m).

As such, the current approach uses a non-dissipative implicit Newmark method to integrate the equations of motion defined in terms of the independent joint co-ordinates of the system. In order to extend the unconditional stability of the implicit Newmark method to non-linear dynamic systems, a discrete energy balance is enforced.

Inputs to the system are typically uncertain, such as (a) the geometry of the arterial tree, (b) clinically measured blood pressure and viscosity, (c) boundary resistances, among others. Due to a large number of such parameters, efficient quantification of uncertainty in solution fields in this multi-parameter space is challenging. We use an adaptive stochastic collocation method to quantify the impact of uncertainty in geometry in patient-specific models. We develop a novel subdivision method to define the stochastic space of geometries. To accelerate convergence and make the problem tractable, we use a machine learning approach to approximate the simulation-based solution. Towards this, a reduced order model of the Navier-Stokes equations is developed using a segmental resistance analog boundary conditions (ratio of pressure to flow). Using an offline database of pre-computed solutions, we compute a map (rule) from the features to solution fields. We achieve significant speed-up (of a few orders of magnitude) by approximating the simulation-based solution using a machine learning predictor. A bootstrap aggregated decision tree was found to be the best predictor among many candidate regressors (correlation coefficient of training set was .). We demonstrate stochastic space convergence using the adaptive stochastic collocation method, and also show robustness to the choice of geometry parameterization. The sensitivities to geometry obtained using machine learning had a correlation coefficient of . with the values obtained using finite element simulations. Segments with significant disease in the larger arteries had the highest sensitivities. Terminal segments are more sensitive to dilation and proximal healthy segments are more sensitive to erosion. Sensitivity to geometry is highest when geometric resistance is comparable to net downstream resistance.",10.1016/j.cma.2015.08.014,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2015.08.014

Especially, the multidisciplinary reliability analysis in the middle layer dominates the whole efficiency of RBMDO. To tackle this problem, first of all, a sequential multidisciplinary reliability analysis (SMRA) approach that integrates the concurrent subspace optimization (CSSO) strategy and the performance measure approach is proposed, in which the multidisciplinary analysis, system sensitivity analysis and reliability analysis are decoupled and arranged sequentially, making a recursive loop. The multidisciplinary analysis and system sensitivity analysis provide the value and gradient information of limit-state function for reliability analysis respectively. As a result, a great number of repeated iterations of the whole reliability analysis are eliminated. Secondly, the CSSO has been integrated with the sequential optimization and reliability assessment (SORA) to decouple the triple-level nested RBMDO procedures into a sequence of cycles of deterministic MDO and multidisciplinary reliability analysis. Therefore, the expensive computation of the whole reliability analysis model in each iteration of RBMDO is avoided. And also, the CSSO is adopted in the deterministic MDO to deal with medium-scale and coupled multidisciplinary systems. The procedures of the proposed approaches are presented in detail.

However, the excessive computational cost produced by repetitively extreme value analysis severely influences the practical application of evidence theory. This paper aims to develop an efficient algorithm for epistemic uncertainty analysis of acoustic problem under evidence theory. Based on the orthogonal polynomial approximation theory, a numerical approach named as the evidence-theory-based Jacobi expansion method (ETJEM) is proposed. In ETJEM, the response of acoustic system with evidence variables is approximated by Jacobi expansion, through which the repetitively extreme value analysis needed in evidence theory can be efficiently performed. The parametric Jacobi polynomial of Jacobi expansion holds a large number of polynomials as special cases, such as the Legendre polynomial and Chebyshev polynomial. Thus, the ETJEM permits a much wider choice of polynomial bases to control the error of approximation than the traditional evidence-theory-based orthogonal polynomial approximation method, in which only the Legendre polynomial is used for approximation. Three numerical examples are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, including a mathematic problem with explicit expression and two engineering applications in acoustic field.

Its accurate prediction remains, however, problematic because: (i) TSS build-up, erosion, and wash-off are not easily identifiable; (ii) calibrating a TSS model requires observations of sediment loads, which are rare, and streamflow observations to calculate concentrations; and (iii) predicted TSS usually deviate systematically from observations, an effect which is commonly neglected. Ignoring systematic errors during calibration can lead to overconfident (i.e. unreliable) uncertainty estimates during predictions. In this paper, we therefore investigate whether a statistical description of systematic model errors makes it possible to generate reliable predictions for TSS. In addition, we explore how the reliability of TSS predictions increases when streamflow data are additionally used in model calibration. A key aspect of our study is that we use a Bayesian multi-output calibration and a novel autoregressive error model, which describes the model predictive error as a sum of independent random noise and autocorrelated bias. Our results show that using a statistical description of model bias provides more reliable uncertainty estimates of TSS than before and including streamflow data into calibration makes TSS predictions more precise.

However, their application is related to specific problems and uncertainties. The reliability of model prediction depends on (i) model concept, (ii) parameters, (iii) uncertainty of input data, and (iv) uncertainty of reference data. How model concept (i) and parameters (ii) effect the model's performance is an often treated problem. However, the effects of (iii) and (iv) are typically ignored or only barely treated in context of regionalisation and generalisation. In this study, the actual measurement uncertainties of input and reference data are the main focus. Furthermore, the evaluation of model results is analysed with regard to uncertainties of reference data. A special feature is the use of evapotranspiration (measured via the eddy covariance) instead of runoff for evaluation of simulation results. It is shown that seemingly small uncertainties of measurements can create significant uncertainties in simulation results depending on the temporal scale of investigation. As an example, the uncertainty of measurements of daily global radiation sum up to an uncertainty of  MJ (equivalent to  mm) on an annual scale, which causes an uncertainty of  mm in simulated grass-reverence evapotranspiration. Summarised and generalised, the measurement uncertainties of all input data create an uncertainty on average of around % in the simulated annual evapotranspiration and of around % in the simulated annual seepage. However, the effects can be significantly higher in years with extreme events and can reach up to %.

Proxy data of discharge and snowfall were used to develop the necessary inputs for the -year runs. The long-term simulations were stable, but conflicts in the simulation of base cation and silica concentrations indicate that the model has a missing process or misrepresents mineral weathering. Sensitivity analysis of the weathering parameters indicates that a weathering rate of approximately % of the value fitted based on a one-year calibration would match the observed base saturation and the initial one year estimate had incorrect stoichiometry. Additionally, comparison of annual modeled mass flux to observed mass flux indicates that the model overestimates cation and silica export in dry years and underestimates export in wet years. Our results indicate that the Emerald Lake watershed; as represented by AHM, is not sensitive to chronic acidification with atmospheric deposition at current levels and that there would be little episodic acidification with a doubling in atmospheric deposition.

Gradient-based methods are preferred to minimise the computational cost of parameter identification studies (and more in general optimisation) with a high number of parameters. However, calculating the cost function's gradient using finite differences becomes prohibitively expensive for a high number of parameters. Therefore, the adjoint equations of the unsteady FSI problem are solved to obtain this gradient at a cost almost independent of the number of parameters. Here, both the forward and the adjoint problems are solved in a partitioned way, which means that the flow equations and the structural equations are solved separately. The application of interest is the identification of the arterial wall's stiffness by comparing the motion of the arterial wall with a reference, possibly obtained from non-invasive imaging.

These heavy-tailed features are associated with rare transient responses due to the occurrence of internal instabilities. Systems with these properties can be found in a variety of areas including mechanics, fluids, and waves. Here we develop a computational method, a probabilistic decomposition-synthesis technique, that takes into account the nature of internal instabilities to inexpensively determine the non-Gaussian probability density function for any arbitrary quantity of interest. Our approach relies on the decomposition of the statistics into a 'non-extreme core', typically Gaussian, and a heavy-tailed component. This decomposition is in full correspondence with a partition of the phase space into a 'stable' region where we have no internal instabilities, and a region where non-linear instabilities lead to rare transitions with high probability. We quantify the statistics in the stable region using a Gaussian approximation approach, while the non-Gaussian distribution associated with the intermittently unstable regions of phase space is inexpensively computed through order-reduction methods that take into account the strongly nonlinear character of the dynamics. The probabilistic information in the two domains is analytically synthesized through a total probability argument. The proposed approach allows for the accurate quantification of non-Gaussian tails at more than  standard deviations, at a fraction of the cost associated with the direct Monte-Carlo simulations. We demonstrate the probabilistic decomposition-synthesis method for rare events for two dynamical systems exhibiting extreme events: a two-degree-of-freedom system of nonlinearly coupled oscillators, and in a nonlinear envelope equation characterizing the propagation of unidirectional water waves.",10.1016/j.jcp.2016.06.047,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2016.06.047

However, flapping wing flight is difficult to simulate accurately because it is a more complex phenomenon than fixed wing or rotorcraft flight. Consequently, the optimization of flapping wing behavior based on simulation is limited and, therefore, we have elected to optimize a wing experimentally. Specifically, we use experimental data to optimize the flapping wing structure for maximum thrust production in hover mode. We point out the similarities or otherwise between experimental optimization and the more common simulation-based optimization. Experimental optimization is hampered by noisy data, which is due to manufacturing variability and testing/measurement uncertainty in this study. These uncertainties must be reduced to an acceptable level and this requires their quantification. Therefore, improvements in manufacturing and testing procedures were implemented to reduce the noise. Another challenge is to limit the number of experiments for reducing time and cost. This is realized by using surrogates, or meta-models, to approximate the response (in this case, thrust) of the wing. In order to take into account the uncertainty, or noise, in the response, we use a Gaussian Process surrogate with noise and a nd order polynomial response surface. We apply a surrogate-based optimization algorithm called Efficient Global Optimization with different sampling criteria and multiple surrogates. This enables us to select multiple points per optimization cycle, which is especially useful in this case as it is more time efficient to manufacture multiple wings at once and this also serves as insurance against failed designs.",10.1007/s00158-014-1184-x,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00158-014-1184-x

The TDR measured sigma(a) and K-a can be used to calculate the soil solution electrical conductivity, sigma(w.) The sigma(w), in turn, can be related to the concentration of an ionic tracer. Several models of the sigma(w)-sigma(a)-K-a relationship can be found in the literature. Most of these models require extensive calibration experiments in order to obtaining best-fit parameters. In this paper, we attempt to model the sigma(w)-sigma(a)-K-a relationship using neural networks (NN). We used TDR measured K-a and sigma(a) along with five different soil physical parameters (sand, silt, clay, and organic matter content and bulk density) measured in nine different soil types using three different sigma(w) levels in each soil type. In total,  K-a and sigma(a) measurements were obtained. The NN estimated sigma(w) was found to have a root mean square error (RMSE) of .-. dS m(-) for the nine different soil types whereas the RMSE of two traditional sigma(w)-sigma(a)-K-a models was .-. dS m(-). Furthermore, the traditional models exhibited larger errors for low sigma(a) and K-a, whereas the NN estimated sigma(w) did not show any trend in the errors. A sensitivity analysis showed that the NN model was more sensitive to small changes in sigma(a) compared to K-a. Of the five soil physical parameters, the silt and clay content affected the sigma(w)-sigma(a)-K-a relationship the most. The results presented shows that using NN, the sigma(w)-sigma(a)-K-a relationship can be predicted using soil physical parameters without need for elaborate soil specific calibration experiments.",10.1016/S0022-1694(02)00387-6,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0022-1694(02)00387-6

This work aims to address this issue by coupling two process-based models to simulate stream temperature in a groundwater-dominated mountain catchment, Alberta, Canada, and using a reach-scale field study for model development and verification. Results suggest that it is possible to produce spatial simulations of hydrometeorological variables needed for process-based stream temperature modelling. Simulated stream energy budget estimates compare well with results from field-based studies, and errors in stream temperature simulations (RMSE < .) are similar to other modelling studies, providing confidence in the methods developed. Model sensitivity analysis demonstrates the importance of incorporating meteorological, hydrological, and geomorphological controls on stream temperature in modelling studies.

The straddle-packer assembly incorporated a hydraulic piston to initiate in situ pulse tests within low hydraulic conductivity (<E- m/s) test intervals.

Analysis of temporal evolution during pump-induced drawdown is one common approach used to estimate the effective transmissivity and storage coefficients in a heterogeneous aquifer. In this study, we propose a Modified Tabu search Method (MTM), an improvement drawn from an alliance between the Tabu Search (TS) and the Adjoint State Method (ASM) developed by Tan et al. (). The latter is employed to estimate effective parameters for anisotropic, heterogeneous aquifers. MTM is validated by several numerical pumping tests. Comparisons are made to other well-known techniques, such as the type-curve method (TCM) and the straight-line method (SLM), to provide insight into the challenge of determining the most effective parameter for an anisotropic, heterogeneous aquifer. The results reveal that MTM can efficiently obtain the best representative and effective aquifer parameters in terms of the least mean square errors of the drawdown estimations. The use of MTM may involve less artificial errors than occur with TCM and SLM, and lead to better solutions. Therefore, effective transmissivity is more likely to be comprised of the geometric mean of all transmissivities within the cone of depression based on a precise estimation of MTM. Further investigation into the applicability of MTM shows that a higher level of heterogeneity in an aquifer can induce an uncertainty in estimations, while the changes in correlation length will affect the accuracy of MTM only once the degree of heterogeneity has also risen.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.05.021,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.05.021

However, such fluxes are hard to quantify. Water volume and solute mass balance models can be used in order to derive an estimate of groundwater fluxes within such systems. This approach is particularly attractive, as it can be undertaken using measurable environmental variables, such as; rainfall, evaporation, pond level and salinity. Groundwater fluxes estimated from such an approach are subject to uncertainty in the measured variables as well as in the process representation and in parameters within the model. However, the shallow nature of seasonal wetland ponds means water volume and surface area can change rapidly and non-linearly with depth, requiring an accurate representation of the wetland pond bathymetry. Unfortunately, detailed bathymetry is rarely available and simplifying assumptions regarding the bathymetry have to be made. However, the implications of these assumptions are typically not quantified. We systematically quantify the uncertainty implications for eight different representations of wetland bathymetry for a shallow seasonal wetland pond in South Australia. The predictive uncertainty estimation methods provided in the Model-Independent Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Analysis software (PEST) are used to quantify the effect of bathymetric uncertainty on the modelled fluxes. We demonstrate that bathymetry can be successfully represented within the model in a simple parametric form using a cubic Sexier curve, allowing an assessment of bathymetric uncertainty due to measurement error and survey detail on the derived groundwater fluxes compared with the fixed bathymetry models. Findings show that different bathymetry conceptualisations can result in very different mass balance components and hence process conceptualisations, despite equally good fits to observed data, potentially leading to poor management decisions for the wetlands. Model predictive uncertainty increases with the crudity of the bathymetry representation, however, approximations that capture the general shape of the wetland pond such as a power law or Bezier curve show only a small increase in prediction uncertainty compared to the full dGPS surveyed bathymetry, implying these may be sufficient for most modelling purposes.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.06.020,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.06.020

Within this optimization procedure all material parameters are identified simultaneously by means of a gradient based method for which a semi-analytical sensitivity analysis is calculated. A representative numerical example is referred to measured data based on short-time and long-time tests of a non-cellular polyurethane.

"Rao, BN | Rahman, S",2005,Continuum shape sensitivity analysis of a mixed-mode fracture in functionally graded materials,Applications_COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING,9,0.69,"This paper presents two new methods for conducting a continuum shape sensitivity analysis of a crack in an isotropic, linear-elastic functionally graded material. These methods involve the material derivative concept from continuum mechanics, domain integral representation of interaction integrals, known as the M-integral, and direct differentiation. Unlike virtual crack extension techniques, no mesh perturbation is needed to calculate the sensitivity of stress-intensity factors. Since the governing variational equation is differentiated prior to the process of discretization, the resulting sensitivity equations are independent of approximate numerical techniques, such as the meshless method, finite element method, boundary element method, or others. Three numerical examples are presented to calculate the first-order derivative of the stress-intensity factors. The results show that first-order sensitivities of stress intensity factors obtained using the proposed method are in excellent agreement with the reference solutions obtained using the finite-difference method for the structural and crack geometries considered in this study.",10.1016/j.cma.2004.06.027,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2004.06.027

Whilst such datasets may provide quantitative information on surface morphology and vegetation structure in riparian zones, existing approaches for processing raw LiDAR data perform poorly in riparian channel environments. A new algorithm for separating vegetation from topography in raw LiDAR data, and the performance of the Elliptical Inverse Distance Weighting (EIDW) procedure for interpolating the remaining ground points, are evaluated using data derived from a semi-arid ephemeral river. The filtering procedure, which first applies a threshold (either slope or elevation) to classify vegetation highpoints, and second a regional growing algorithm from these high-points, avoids the classification of high channel banks as vegetation, preserving existing channel morphology for subsequent interpolation (.-.% calibration error; .-.% error in evaluation for slope threshold). EIDW, which accounts for surface anisotropy by converting the remaining elevation points to streamwise co-ordinates, can outperform isoptropic interpolation (IDW) on channel banks, however, performs less well in isotropic conditions, and when local anisotropy is different to that of the main channel. A key finding of this research is that filtering parameter uncertainty affects the performance of the interpolation procedure; resultant errors may propagate into the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and subsequently derived products, such as Canopy Height Models (CHMs). Consequently, it is important that this uncertainty is assessed. Understanding and developing methods to deal with such errors is important to inform users of the true quality of laser scanning products, such that they can be used effectively in hydrological applications.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.03.043,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.03.043
"Rajabi, MM | Ataie-Ashtiani, B",2016,Efficient fuzzy Bayesian inference algorithms for incorporating expert knowledge in parameter estimation,Applications_JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,9,4.5,"Bayesian inference has traditionally been conceived as the proper framework for the formal incorporation of expert knowledge in parameter estimation of groundwater models. However, conventional Bayesian inference is incapable of taking into account the imprecision essentially embedded in expert provided information. In order to solve this problem, a number of extensions to conventional Bayesian inference have been introduced in recent years. One of these extensions is 'fuzzy Bayesian inference' which is the result of integrating fuzzy techniques into Bayesian statistics. Fuzzy Bayesian inference has a number of desirable features which makes it an attractive approach for incorporating expert knowledge in the parameter estimation process of groundwater models: () it is well adapted to the nature of expert provided information, () it allows to distinguishably model both uncertainty and imprecision, and () it presents a framework for fusing expert provided information regarding the various inputs of the Bayesian inference algorithm. However an important obstacle in employing fuzzy Bayesian inference in groundwater numerical modeling applications is the computational burden, as the required number of numerical model simulations often becomes extremely exhaustive and often computationally infeasible. In this paper, a novel approach of accelerating the fuzzy Bayesian inference algorithm is proposed which is based on using approximate posterior distributions derived from surrogate modeling, as a screening tool in the computations. The proposed approach is first applied to a synthetic test case of seawater intrusion (SWI) in a coastal aquifer. It is shown that for this synthetic test case, the proposed approach decreases the number of required numerical simulations by an order of magnitude. Then the proposed approach is applied to a real-world test case involving three-dimensional numerical modeling of SWI in Kish Island, located in the Persian Gulf. An expert elicitation methodology is developed and applied to the real-world test case in order to provide a road map for the use of fuzzy Bayesian inference in groundwater modeling applications.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.02.029,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.02.029

In this application, a stochastic subsystem model is coupled with a deterministic subsystem model to analyze stochastic system response to stochastic forcing functions. The weak nonlinearity of the stochastic subsystem was characterized by testing it at three different input levels, low, medium and high. The calibrated subsystem models were validated with additional test data using published NASA and Air Force validation criteria. The validated subsystem models were first installed in the accreditation test bed where system response simulations involving stochastic shock-type force inputs were conducted.

An optimization model based on the minimum structural compliance with a specified composite volume constraint is established. The ply angle and the distribution of the composite material are introduced as independent variables in two geometric scales (material and structural scales). The void material is added into the optional discrete material set to realize the topology change of the structure. This paper proposes an improved HPDMO (Heaviside Penalization of Discrete Material Optimization) model to obtain a better convergent result, and an explicit sensitivity analysis is performed. The effects of the HPDMO model on the convergence rate of the optimization results, the objective function value and the iteration history are studied and compared with those from the classical Discrete Material Optimization model and the Continuous Discrete Material Optimization model in this paper. Numerical examples in this paper show that the HPDMO model can effectively achieve the integrated optimization of the fiber ply angle and its distribution in the structural domain, and can also considerably improve the convergence rate of the optimal results compared with other DMO models.

The compressive stress induced by thermal environment is considered as pre-stress in dynamic analysis, which could reduce stiffness of the structure and alter the optimal topology. Sensitivity analysis is carried out through adjoint method efficiently. As natural frequencies are constantly changing during the optimization, the associated sensitivity should be calculated in which multiple-frequency case is briefly discussed. Mode switching may occur during the optimization, and mode tracking technique is adopted. Numerical results show that the topology is mainly determined by the excited modes, and could be altered by the location of the applied load if different modes are excited.

Uncertainties may exist both in material properties and in the geometry of the device. They can be due, for instance, to ageing or imperfections in the manufacturing process. Input data can be modelled as random variables leading to a stochastic model. In electromagnetism, this leads to solution of a stochastic partial differential equation system. The Solution can be approximated by a linear combination of basis functions rising from the tensorial product of the basis functions used to discretize the space (nodal shape function for example) and basis functions used to discretize the random dimension (a polynomial chaos expansion for example). Some methods (SSFEM, collocation) have been proposed in the literature to calculate such approximation. The issue is then how to compare the different approaches in an objective way. One solution is to use all appropriate a posteriori numerical error estimator. In this paper, we present an error estimator based on the constitutive relation error in electrokinetics, which allows the calculation of the distance between an average solution and the unknown exact solution. The method of calculation of the error is detailed in this paper from two Solutions that satisfy the two equilibrium equations.

The principal idea is to find a solution to an inverse problem, where the variability on the output side of the model is known from measurement data, but the multivariate uncertainty on the input parameters is unknown. For this purpose, the uncertain simulation results set created by propagating interval uncertainty through the model is represented by its convex hull. The same concept is used to model the uncertainty in the measurements. A metric to describe the discrepancy between these convex hulls is defined based on the difference between their volumes and their mutual intersection. By minimisation of this metric, the interval uncertainty on the input side of the model is identified. It is further shown how the procedure can be optimised with respect to output quantity selection. Validation of the methodology is done using simulated measurement data in two case studies. Numerically exact identification of multiple, coupled parameters having interval uncertainty is possible following the proposed methodology. Furthermore, the robustness of the method with respect to the analyst's initial estimate of the input uncertainty is illustrated.

The typical nonlinear concentration of posterior measure observed in many such Inverse Problems presents severe challenges to existing simulation based inference methods. Motivated by these challenges the exploitation of local geometric information in the form of covariant gradients, metric tensors, Levi-Civita connections, and local geodesic flows have been introduced to more effectively locally explore the configuration space of the posterior measure. However, obtaining such geometric quantities usually requires extensive computational effort and despite their effectiveness affects the applicability of these geometrically-based Monte Carlo methods. In this paper we explore one way to address this issue by the construction of an emulator of the model from which all geometric objects can be obtained in a much more computationally feasible manner. The main concept is to approximate the geometric quantities using a Gaussian Process emulator which is conditioned on a carefully chosen design set of configuration points, which also determines the quality of the emulator. To this end we propose the use of statistical experiment design methods to refine a potentially arbitrarily initialized design online without destroying the convergence of the resulting Markov chain to the desired invariant measure.

The sensitivity of CLM-simulated water and energy fluxes to hydrological parameters across  MOPEX basins are first examined using an efficient stochastic sampling-based sensitivity analysis approach. Linear, interaction, and high-order nonlinear impacts are all identified via statistical tests and stepwise backward removal parameter screening.

This uncertainty of the SSEBop model lies within the error range of other SEB models, suggesting systematic error or bias of the SSEBop model is within the normal range. This finding implies that the simplified parameterization of the SSEBop model did not significantly affect the accuracy of the ET estimate while increasing the ease of model setup for operational applications. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the SSEBop model is most sensitive to input variables, land surface temperature (LST) and reference ET (ET); and parameters, differential temperature (dT), and maximum ET scalar (K-max), particularly during the non-growing season and in dry areas. In summary, the uncertainty assessment verifies that the SSEBop model is a reliable and robust method for large-area ET estimation. The SSEBop model estimates can be further improved by reducing errors in two input variables (ET and LST) and two key parameters (Kmax and dT).

A quasi-three-dimensional aerodynamic solver is developed and connected to a finite beam element model for wing aerostructural optimization. In a quasi-three-dimensional approach an inviscid incompressible vortex lattice method is coupled with a viscous compressible airfoil analysis code for drag prediction of a three dimensional wing. The accuracy of the proposed method for wing drag prediction is validated by comparing its results with the results of a higher fidelity CFD analysis. The wing structural deformation as well as the stress distribution in the wingbox structure is computed using a finite beam element model. The Newton method is used to solve the coupled system. The sensitivities of the outputs, for example the wing drag, with respect to the inputs, for example the wing geometry, is computed by a combined use of the coupled adjoint method, automatic differentiation and the chain rule of differentiation. A gradient based optimization is performed using the proposed tool for minimizing the fuel weight of an A class aircraft.

This paper presents a design sensitivity analysis method, using direct differentiation and generalized recursive formulas. The equations of motion are first generated in the Cartesian coordinate system and then transformed into the relative coordinate system by using a velocity transformation. The design-sensitivity equations are derived by directly differentiating the equations of motion. The equations of motion and of design sensitivity are discritized by using the backward difference formula (BDF) in time domain. The resulting equations constitute an overdetermined differential algebraic system (ODAS) and are treated as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) on manifolds. The computational structure of the resulting equations is examined to classify all necessary computations into several categories. The generalized recursive formula for each category is then developed and applied whenever such a category of computation is encountered in the equations of motion and of design sensitivity. Since the velocity transformation yields the equations in a compact form and computational efficiency is achieved by the generalized recursive formulas, the proposed method is not only easy to implement but also efficient.

Nevertheless, the variance is not a universal criterion for ranking variables, since non symmetric outputs could require higher order statistics for their description and analysis. In this work, we illustrate how third and fourth-order moments, i.e. skewness and kurtosis, respectively, can be decomposed mimicking the ANOVA approach. It is also shown how this decomposition is correlated to a Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansion leading to a simple strategy to compute each term. New sensitivity indices, based on the contribution to the skewness and kurtosis, are proposed. The outcome of the proposed analysis is depicted by considering several test functions. Moreover, the ranking of the sensitivity indices is shown to vary according to their statistics order. Furthermore, the problem of formulating a truncated polynomial representation of the original function is treated. Both the reduction of the number of dimensions and the reduction of the order of interaction between parameters are considered. In both cases, the impact on the reduction is assessed in terms of statistics, namely the probability density function.

First, for linear performance functions with independent normal random inputs, an exact probability of failure is derived in terms of the ratio of the input standard deviation, which is denoted by . Then, the probability of failure estimation is generalized for other types of random inputs and performance functions. For the generalization of the probability of failure estimation, two types of coefficients need to be determined by equating the probability of failure and its sensitivities with respect to the input standard deviation at the given design point. The sensitivities of the probability of failure with respect to the standard deviation are obtained using the first-order score function for the standard deviation. To apply the proposed method to an RBDO problem, a concept of an equivalent target probability of failure, which is an increased target probability of failure corresponding to the increased input standard deviations, is also introduced. Numerical results indicate that the proposed method can estimate the probability of failure accurately as a function of the input standard deviation compared to the Monte Carlo simulation results. As anticipated, the sampling-based RBDO using equivalent target probability of failure helps find the optimum design very efficiently while yielding reasonably accurate optimum design, which is close to the one obtained using the original target probability of failure.",10.1007/s00158-013-0905-x,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00158-013-0905-x

This interest stems from the realization that the achieved high-performance designs resulted from deterministic topology optimization algorithms may become suboptimal under real-world conditions that are often accompanied with uncertainties. Among sources of these uncertainties, the ones that define structural characteristics, such as geometry, are numerically challenging to treat as they lead to stochastic structural stiffness. To date, research on developing efficient probabilistic topology optimization under stochastic stiffness is mainly focused on displacement-based objectives. However, in the design of structures, stress is also a primary design criterion that needs to be directly controlled for. A robust stress-based topology optimization methodology for frame structures under geometric uncertainty is proposed in this work. Assuming that such uncertainties are small relative to frame member lengths, the proposed methodology uses stochastic perturbation method to propagate these uncertainties up to the response level, which is expressed by the maximum of expected values of von Mises stresses throughout the domain. Sensitivities of the response with respect to design variables are derived analytically, which allows using efficient gradient-based optimizers. The proposed algorithm is examined with stress-based design of three frame structures under geometric uncertainty. Changes in the topology of these new designs are discussed, and they are shown to outperform deterministic designs when subjected to geometric uncertainties.

A crucial setting of the scope involves establishing the number of data required to counterbalance limitations in the measurement accuracy and frequency of data collection. This study also compares the merits and drawbacks of the classical rating curve (C = aQ(b)) with those of an improved rating curve approach (IRCA: C=aQ(b) + a delta S) in which the correction term is an indicator of the variations in sediment storage, thus relating it to flow dynamics. This alternative formulation remedies the known systematic underestimations in the classical rating curve and correctly resists the degradation in data quality and availability, as shown in a series of problematic though realistic cases. For example, monthly concentration samplings (in average) with a random relative error in the [-%, +%] range combined with daily discharge records with a systematic relative error in the [-%, +%] range still yield SPM fluxes within factors of .-. of the real value, provided that  years of data are available. A shorter -day time interval (on average) between samplings lowers the relative error in the SPM fluxes to below %, a result directly related to the increased number of Q-C pairs available for fitting. For regional-scale applications, this study may be used to define the data quality level (uncertainty, frequency and/or number) compatible with reliable computation of river sediment fluxes.

Only then probabilities for the failure of a specific management option or the exceedance of critical thresholds (e.g. of pollutants) can be derived. A new approach of uncertainty propagation in hydrological equations is developed that directly propagates the probability density functions of uncertain model input parameters into the corresponding probability density functions of model output. The basics of the methodology are presented and central applications to different disciplines in hydrology are shown. This work focuses on the following basic hydrological equations: () pumping test analysis (Theis-equation, propagation of uncertainties in recharge and transmissivity), () -dim groundwater contaminant transport equation (Gauss-equation, propagation of uncertainties in decay constant and dispersivity), () evapotranspiration estimation (Penman-Monteith-equation, propagation of uncertainty in roughness length). The direct propagation of probability densities is restricted to functions that are monotonically increasing or decreasing or that can be separated in corresponding monotonic branches so that inverse functions can be derived. In case no analytic solutions for inverse functions could be derived, semi-analytical approximations were used. It is shown that the results of direct probability density function propagation are in perfect agreement with results obtained from corresponding Monte Carlo derived frequency distributions. Direct pdf propagation, however, has the advantage that is yields exact solutions for the resulting hydrological pdfs rather than approximating discontinuous frequency distributions. It is additionally shown that the type of the resulting pdf depends on the specific values (order of magnitude, respectively) of the standard deviation of the input pdf.

The nuclides are retarded as they diffuse in the porous rock matrix and stagnant zones in the fracture. The Laplace transform and similarity transform techniques are applied to solve the model. The analytical solution to the nuclide concentrations at the fracture outlet is governed by nine parameters representing different mechanisms acting on nuclide transport through a fracture, including diffusion into the rock matrices, diffusion into the stagnant water zone, chain decay and hydrodynamic dispersion. Furthermore, to assess how sensitive the results are to parameter uncertainties, the Sobol method is applied in variance-based global sensitivity analyses of the model output. The Sobol indices show how uncertainty in the model output is apportioned to the uncertainty in the model input. This method takes into account both direct effects and interaction effects between input parameters. The simulation results suggest that in the case of pulse injections, ignoring the effect of a stagnant water zone can lead to significant errors in the time-of-first arrival and the peak value of the nuclides. Likewise, neglecting the parent and modeling its daughter as a single stable species can result in a significant overestimation of the peak value of the daughter nuclide. It is also found that as the dispersion increases, the early arrival time and the peak time of the daughter decrease while the peak value increases. More importantly, the global sensitivity analysis reveals that for time periods greater than a few thousand years, the uncertainty of the model output is more sensitive to the values of the individual parameters than to the interaction between them. Moreover, if one tries to evaluate the true values of the input parameters at the same cost and effort, the determination of priorities should follow a certain sequence.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.10.060,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.10.060

The shape of the hole is designed, and the material design is the design of an orthotropic material that can be considered as a fiber-net within each finite element. This fiber-net is optimally oriented in the individual elements of the finite element discretization. The optimizations are performed using the finite element method for analysis, and the optimization approach is a two-step method.

"Zhu, YH | Zhan, HB | Jin, MG",2016,Analytical solutions of solute transport in a fracture-matrix system with different reaction rates for fracture and matrix,Applications_JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,7,3.5,"This study deals with the problem of reactive solute transport in a fracture-matrix system using both analytical and numerical modeling methods. The groundwater flow velocity in the fracture is assumed to be high enough (no less than . m/day) to ensure the advection-dominant transport in the fracture. The problem includes advection along the fracture, transverse diffusion in the matrix, with linear sorption as well as first-order reactions operative in both the fracture and the matrix. A constant concentration boundary condition and a decay source boundary condition in the fracture are considered. With a constant-concentration source, we obtain closed-form analytical solutions that account for the transport without reaction as well as steady-state solutions with different first-order reactions in the two media. With a decay source, a semi-analytical solution is obtained. The analytical and semi analytical solutions are in excellent agreement with the numerical simulation results obtained using COMSOL Multiphysics. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the relative importance of matrix diffusion coefficient, fracture aperture, and matrix porosity. We conclude that the first-order reaction as well as the matrix diffusion in the fractured rock would decrease the solute peak concentration and shorten the penetration distance into the fracture. The solutions can be applied to assess the spatial-temporal distribution of concentrations in the fracture and the matrix as well as to assess the contaminant mass stored in the rock matrix.

A finite difference model is developed in MATLAB to solve the two-dimensional mixed-type boundary value problem associated with flow to a partially penetrating well within a cylindrical confined aquifer. Non-Darcy effects are incorporated using the Forchheimer equation. The model is verified by comparison to results from existing semi-analytical solutions concerning the same problem but assuming Darcy's law. A sensitivity analysis is presented to explore the problem of concern. For constant pressure production, Non-Darcy effects lead to a reduction in production rate, as compared to an equivalent problem solved using Darcy's law. For fully penetrating wells, this reduction in production rate becomes less significant with time. However, for partially penetrating wells, the reduction in production rate persists for much larger times. For constant production rate scenarios, the combined effect of PWP and non-Darcy flow takes the form of a constant additional drawdown term. An approximate solution for this loss term is obtained by performing linear regression on the modeling results.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.02.015,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.02.015

A general equation is adopted to represent the top boundary condition which is applicable to either a confined, unconfined or leaky aquifer. The Robin (third-type) boundary condition is employed to represent the low-permeability streambeds. The Laplace-domain head solution of the model is derived by the double-integral and Laplace transforms. The Laplace-domain solution for a stream depletion rate (SDR) describing filtration from the streams is developed based on Darcy's law and the head solution and inverted to the timedomain result by the Crump method. In addition, the time-domain solution of SDR for the confined aquifer is developed analytically after taking the inverse Laplace transform and the time-domain solutions of SDR for the leaky and unconfined aquifers are developed using the Fade approximation. Both approximate solutions of SDR are expressed in terms of simple series and give fairly good match with the Laplace-domain SDR solution and measured data from a field experiment in New Zealand. The uncertainties in SDR predictions for the aquifers are assessed by performing the sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. With the aid of the time-domain solutions, we have found that the effect of the vertical groundwater flow on the temporal SDR for a leaky aquifer is dominated by two lumped parameters: it = K (v)x()()/(KhD) and k'=k'(B'K-v) where D is the aquifer thickness, x(o) is a distance between the well and nearer stream, K-h and K are the aquifer horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities, respectively, and K' and B' are the aquitard hydraulic conductivity and thickness, respectively. When it < , neglecting the vertical flow underestimates the SDR. When it >= , the effect of vertical flow is negligible.

This model is also applicable to heat conduction problems for a composite hollow cylinder on the basis of the analogy between heat flow and groundwater flow. The time-domain solution of the model is derived by the methods of Laplace transform, Bromwich integral, and residue theorem. This new solution can reduce to the solution for constant-head test (CHT) or constant-rate test (CRT) problem by specifying appropriate coefficients at the Robin inner boundary condition. The solution describing the flow rate across the wellbore due to CHT is further developed by applying Darcy's law to the new solution. In addition, steady-state solutions for both CHT and CRT are also developed based on the approximation for Bessel functions with very small argument values. Many existing solutions for transient flow in homogeneous or two-zone finite aquifers with Dirichlet or no-flow condition at the outer boundary are shown to be special cases of the present solution. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis is also performed to investigate the behaviors of the wellbore flow due to CHT and the aquifer drawdown induced by CRT in response to the change in each of aquifer parameters.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.07.028,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.07.028

As a result of this strategy, the solutions of presented algorithm are sufficiently smooth and possess the regularity of H- function space. A simple method for the continuum adjoint sensitivity analysis of the corresponding PDE-constrained optimization problem is presented. It is general and can be easily applied to a wide range of alternative problems. The success of the introduced algorithm is studied by numerical experiments on two-dimensional model problems for different numbers of phases.

Model (I) is widely used in engineering and physical applications while model (II) is usually studied from the mathematical point of view. The difference between the above two stochastic elliptic models has not been fully clarified. In this work, we discuss the difference between models (I) and (II) when a(x,omega) is a log-normal random process. We show that the difference between models (I) and (II) is mainly characterized by a scaling factor, which is an exponential function of the degree of perturbation of a(x,w).

"Hu, Z | Mahadevan, S",2017,A surrogate modeling approach for reliability analysis of a multidisciplinary system with spatio-temporal output,Applications_STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION,6,6.0,"Reliability analysis of a multidisciplinary system is computationally intensive due to the involvement of multiple disciplinary models and coupling between the individual models. When the system inputs and outputs are varying over time and space, the reliability analysis is even more challenging. This paper proposes a surrogate model-based method for the reliability analysis of a multidisciplinary system with spatio-temporal output. The transient characteristics of the multidisciplinary system output under time-dependent variability are analyzed first. Based on the transient analysis, surrogate models are built for individual disciplinary analyses instead of a single surrogate model for the fully coupled analysis. To address the challenge introduced by the high-dimensionality of spatially varying inter-disciplinary coupling variables, a data compression method is first employed to convert the high-dimensional coupling variables into low-dimensional latent space. Kriging surrogate modeling is then used to build surrogates for the individual disciplinary models in the latent space. Based on the individual disciplinary surrogate models, reliability analysis of the coupled multidisciplinary system under time-dependent uncertainty is investigated. Further, epistemic uncertainty sources, such as data uncertainty and model uncertainty, lead to uncertainty in the reliability estimate. Therefore, an auxiliary variable approach is used to efficiently include the epistemic uncertainty sources within the reliability analysis. An aircraft panel subjected to hypersonic flow conditions is used to demonstrate the proposed method. The analysis involves four interacting disciplinary models, namely, aerodynamics, aerothermal analysis, heat transfer, and structural analysis. The results show that the proposed method is able to effectively perform reliability analysis of a multidisciplinary system with spatio-temporal output.",10.1007/s00158-017-1737-x,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00158-017-1737-x

The damping scheme constraining the variance of the sensitivity numbers stabilizes the topological evolution process in particular for dissipative structural designs. By setting initially a large filter radius value and reducing it gradually, the emergence of the redundant structural branches, which are to be eliminated afterwards and are the main reasons deteriorating the design process, could be avoided.

In this study, a comprehensive comparison is conducted on the sensitivity of two commonly used standardization procedures (SP) in drought indices to datasets, namely the probability distribution based SP and the self-calibrating Palmer SP. The standardized Palmer drought index (SPDI) and the self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index (SC-PDSI) are selected as representatives of the two SPs, respectively. Using meteorological observations (-) in the Yellow River basin,  sub-datasets with a length of  years are firstly generated with the moving window method. Then we use the whole time series and  sub-datasets to compute two indices separately, and compare their spatiotemporal differences, as well as performances in capturing drought areas. Finally, a systematic investigation in term of changing climatic conditions and varied parameters in each SP is conducted. Results show that SPDI is less sensitive to data selection than SC-PDSI. SPDI series derived from different datasets are highly correlated, and consistent in drought area characterization. Sensitivity analysis shows that among the three parameters in the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, SPDI is most sensitive to changes in the scale parameter, followed by location and shape parameters. For SC-PDSI, its inconsistent behaviors among different datasets are primarily induced by the self-calibrated duration factors (p and q). In addition, it is found that the introduction of the self-calibrating procedure for duration factors further aggravates the dependence of drought index on input datasets compared with original empirical algorithm that Palmer uses, making SC-PDSI more sensitive to variations in data sample.

To prevent this instability without resorting to either multi-element local polynomial chaos (PC) methods or increasing the order of the PC representation in time, we propose a procedure aimed at modifying the amplitude of the PC modes to bring the probability of negative state values below a user-defined threshold. This modification can be effectively described as a filtering procedure of the spectral PC coefficients, which is applied on-the-fly during the numerical integration when the current value of the probability of negative states exceeds the prescribed threshold. We demonstrate the filtering procedure using a simple model of an ignition process in a batch reactor. This is carried out by comparing different observables and error measures as obtained by non-intrusive Monte Carlo and Gauss-quadrature integration and the filtered intrusive procedure. The filtering procedure has been shown to effectively stabilize divergent intrusive solutions, and also to improve the accuracy of stable intrusive solutions which are close to the stability limits.",10.1016/j.jcp.2014.03.061,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2014.03.061

Although for many stochastic systems of practical interest, described by stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), solutions possess this low-dimensional character, they also have a strongly time-dependent form and to this end a fixed-in-time basis may not describe the solution in an efficient way. Motivated by this limitation of standard KL expansion, Sapsis and Lermusiaux () [] developed the dynamically orthogonal (DO) field equations which allow for the simultaneous evolution of both the spatial basis where uncertainty 'lives' but also the stochastic characteristics of uncertainty. Recently, Cheng et al. () [] introduced an alternative approach, the bi-orthogonal (BO) method, which performs the exact same tasks, i.e. it evolves the spatial basis and the stochastic characteristics of uncertainty. In the current work we examine the relation of the two approaches and we prove theoretically and illustrate numerically their equivalence, in the sense that one method is an exact reformulation of the other. We show this by deriving a linear and invertible transformation matrix described by a matrix differential equation that connects the BO and the DO solutions. We also examine a pathology of the BO equations that occurs when two eigenvalues of the solution cross, resulting in an instantaneous, infinite-speed, internal rotation of the computed spatial basis. We demonstrate that despite the instantaneous duration of the singularity this has important implications on the numerical performance of the BO approach. On the other hand, it is observed that the BO is more stable in nonlinear problems involving a relatively large number of modes. Several examples, linear and nonlinear, are presented to illustrate the DO and BO methods as well as their equivalence.",10.1016/j.jcp.2014.03.050,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2014.03.050

We then provide a complexity analysis that assumes decay rates of product type for such mixed differences, showing that in the optimal case the convergence rate of MISC is only dictated by the convergence of the deterministic solver applied to a one dimensional problem.

The conclusions of this study are that the applied method gives a possibility to illustrate and interpret the variation of the response versus a design parameter variation. Consequently, it gives significant insights into the usefulness of individual design parameters. It has been shown that the method enables us to estimate the admissible design parameter variations and to predict the actual safe margin for given process parameters.

Metamodeling techniques are widely used to replace the original time-consuming computer simulation models to further reduce computational burden in multi-level system performance analysis and design optimization. However, due to the limited samples from simulation models, metamodels may contain metamodeling uncertainties at un-sampled sites. Such metamodeling uncertainties arising from metamodels across the entire hierarchy will propagate from the lower to upper levels and eventually impact the top-level response of interest. With the aim of improving the global fidelity of metamodels for multi-level system performance analysis and design optimization, a new sequential sampling strategy is proposed in this paper. The proposed method contains two basic elements: () quantifying metamodeling uncertainty propagated from the lower-level metamodels to the top-level response of interest and () seeking a new sample site at which the global fidelity of the multi-level system model can be maximally improved.

More precisely, this work is devoted to the stochastic modeling and inverse identification of the random field associated with the elastic properties in the so-called interphase region. For illustration purposes, a prototypical polymer system reinforced by a Silica nanoscopic inclusion is considered. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are first performed and used to characterize the conformational properties of the polymer chains in the neighborhood of the inclusion. It is shown that these chains are characterized by a specific tangential orientation which, together with the density profile and variations in chain mobility, allows for the geometric definition of the interphase region. Mechanical virtual testing is next completed on a set of initial configurations, hence providing a simulated database for model calibration. The results thus obtained are subsequently used to construct a random field model for the interphase stiffness. An inverse calibration procedure is finally proposed and relies on a stated equivalence between the apparent properties obtained from MD simulations and those computed by numerical homogenization in the continuum mechanics formulation.

Because an external excitation frequency can be lower than the fundamental eigenfrequency or between the eigenfrequencies of a structure, there is a strong need for eigenfrequency optimization technology to optimize the fundamental eigenfrequency and, in addition, the k-th eigenfrequency and to maximize the gap between eigenfrequencies. However, previous optimization studies on vibrating elastic structures that used the level set method have been devoted to the optimization of the fundamental eigenfrequency, whereas the higher-order eigenfrequencies optimization problem has seldom been considered. This paper presents an eigenfrequency optimization technology that is based on the compactly supported radial basis functions (CS-RBFs) parameterized level-set method, using the fundamental eigenfrequency, the eigenfrequency of a given higher-order, and the gap between two consecutive eigenfrequencies as the optimization objectives. Furthermore, to address the oscillation problem of the objective function, we adopt an exponential weighted optimization model of a number of the lower eigenfrequencies for multiple eigenvalue optimizations, and we utilize mode-tracking technology for the single eigenvalue optimization.In addition, we further extend the CS-RBFs parameterized level-set method to an optimization that is performed with geometric constraints, which means that the size and position of the regular holes in the structure can be optimized with the shape and topology.

In the context of high performance computing, the preconditioner must scale to a large number of processors. Therefore in this paper, a two-level additive Schwarz pre-conditioner is described for the iterative solution of the SSFEM linear system.

More broadly, low-dimensional stochastic representation of random fields with finite variance is provided via the well known Karhunen-Loeve expansion (KLE). The KLE is analogous to a Fourier series expansion for a random process, where the goal is to find an orthogonal transformation for the data such that the projection of the data onto this orthogonal subspace is optimal in the L- sense, i.e., which minimizes the mean square error. In practice, this orthogonal transformation is determined by performing an SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) on the sample covariance matrix or on the data matrix itself. Sampling error is typically ignored when quantifying the principal components, or, equivalently, basis functions of the KLE. Furthermore, it is exacerbated when the sample size is much smaller than the dimension of the random field. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian KLE procedure, allowing one to obtain a probabilistic model on the principal components, which can account for inaccuracies due to limited sample size. The probabilistic model is built via Bayesian inference, from which the posterior becomes the matrix Bingham density over the space of orthonormal matrices. We use a modified Gibbs sampling procedure to sample on this space and then build probabilistic Karhunen-Loeve expansions over random subspaces to obtain a set of low-dimensional surrogates of the stochastic process.

The link between elastic and petrophysical properties is given by a joint prior distribution for the logarithm of impedance and porosity, based on a rock-physics model. The well conditioning is performed through a background model obtained by well log interpolation. Two different approaches are presented: in the first approach, the prior is defined by a single Gaussian distribution, whereas in the second approach it is defined by a Gaussian mixture to represent the well data multimodal distribution and link the Gaussian components to different geological lithofacies. The forward model is based on a linearized convolutional model. For the single Gaussian case, we obtain an analytical expression for the posterior distribution, resulting in a fast algorithm to compute the solution of the inverse problem, i.e. the posterior distribution of acoustic impedance and porosity as well as the facies probability given the observed data. For the Gaussian mixture prior, it is not possible to obtain the distributions analytically, hence we propose a Gibbs algorithm to perform the posterior sampling and obtain several reservoir model realizations, allowing an uncertainty analysis of the estimated properties and lithofacies.

The response to a slug test conducted in such a well is usually characterised by significant water level oscillations developing inside the branched pipe system. In the present paper, a general non-linear model is developed for the analysis of slug tests performed in bypassed wells, The model includes skin effects, non-linear head losses due to internal well bore fluid friction minor losses originating at radius change, along the flow path inside the well and inertial effects of the water columns contained within the primary casing and the bypass Pipe flow inside the branched tubing system is described by the one-dimensional conservation law of the mechanical energy of the well bore fluid. Aquifer flow is quartified by a convolution-type approach. The coupled well-aquifer system is governed by all integro-differential equation representing the mean mechanical energy of the total kell bore fluid and, coupled to it, by a non-linear ordinary differential equation which accounts for mechanical energy fluctuations between the water columns inside the main casing and the bypass. Both equations are solved by finite difference approximations coupled to point iterative numerical techniques. An application of the model to field data suggests that non-linear hydraulic head losses originating inside the well bore may cause the measured head responses to depend on the initial displacement. A packer used to initiate a slug test can induce these non-linear distortions through the combined effect of minor losses originating at the inlet and the outlet of a small diameter packer flow-through tube and internal fluid friction potentially developing inside that packer passage.

Examples of practical applications are manifold and include, among others, managed aquifer recharge schemes, aquifer thermal energy storage systems and, increasingly important, the disposal of produced water from oil and shale gas wells. The hydrogeological and geochemical data collected during the injection tests are often employed to assess the potential impacts of injection on receptors such as drinking water wells and regularly serve as a basis for the development of conceptual and numerical models that underpin the prediction of potential impacts. As all field tracer injection tests impose substantial logistical and financial efforts, it is crucial to develop a solid a-priori understanding of the value of the various monitoring data to select monitoring strategies which provide the greatest return on investment. In this study, we demonstrate the ability of linear predictive uncertainty analysis (i.e. ""data worth analysis"") to quantify the usefulness of different tracer types (bromide, temperature, methane and chloride as examples) and head measurements in the context of a field-scale aquifer injection trial of coal seam gas (CSG) co-produced water. Data worth was evaluated in terms of tracer type, in terms of tracer test design (e.g., injection rate, duration of test and the applied measurement frequency) and monitoring disposition to increase the reliability of injection impact assessments. This was followed by an uncertainty targeted Pareto analysis, which allowed the interdependencies of cost and predictive reliability for alternative monitoring campaigns to be compared directly. For the evaluated injection test, the data worth analysis assessed bromide as superior to head data and all other tracers during early sampling times. However, with time, chloride became a more suitable tracer to constrain simulations of physical transport processes, followed by methane. Temperature data was assessed as the least informative of the solute tracers. However, taking costs of data acquisition into account, it could be shown that temperature data when used in conjunction with other tracers was a valuable and cost-effective marker species due to temperatures low cost to worth ratio. In contrast, the high costs of acquisition of methane data compared to its muted worth, highlighted methanes unfavourable return on investment.

Such methods are prone to perturbations of the rock samples by collection and preparation and therefore the laboratory-derived transport properties and fluid composition might not represent in situ conditions. We investigated the effects induced by the drilling process and natural rock stress release by mass balance considerations and sensitivity analysis of analytical out-diffusion data obtained from originally saturated, large-sized drillcore material from two locations drilled using traced drilling fluid. For in situ stress-released drillcores of quartz-monzodiorite composition from the Aspo HRL, Sweden, tracer mass balance considerations and D and D diffusion modelling consistently indicated a contamination of <% of the original pore water. This chemically disturbed zone extends to a maximum of . mm into the drillcore (. mm x . mm) corresponding to about .% of the total pore volume (. vol.%). In contrast, the combined effects of stress release and the drilling process, which have influenced granodioritic drillcore material from  m below surface at Forsmark. Sweden, resulted in a maximum contamination of the derived porewater Cl(-) concentration of about %. The mechanically disturbed zone with modified diffusion properties covers the outermost similar to  mm of the drillcore ( mm x  mm), whereas the chemically disturbed zone extends to a maximum of . mm based on mass balance considerations, and to . mm to . mm into the drillcore based on fitting the observed tracer data. This corresponds to a maximum of .% of the total pore volume (. vol.%) being affected by the drilling-fluid contamination. The proportion of rock volume affected initially by drilling fluid or subsequently with experiment water during the laboratory diffusion and re-saturation experiments depends on the size of the drillcore material and will become larger the smaller the sample used for the experiment.

However, offline training of reduced order models (ROMs) can have prohibitively expensive memory and floating-point operation costs in high-performance computing applications, where memory per core is limited. To overcome this limitation for proper orthogonal decomposition, we propose a novel adaptive selection method for snapshots in time that limits offline training costs by selecting snapshots according an error control mechanism similar to that found in adaptive time-stepping ordinary differential equation solvers. The error estimator used in this work is related to theory bounding the approximation error in time of proper orthogonal decomposition-based ROMs, and memory usage is minimized by computing the singular value decomposition using a single-pass incremental algorithm. Results for a viscous Burgers' test problem demonstrate convergence in the limit as the algorithm error tolerances go to zero; in this limit, the full-order model is recovered to within discretization error. A parallel version of the resulting method can be used on supercomputers to generate proper orthogonal decomposition-based ROMs, or as a subroutine within hyperreduction algorithms that require taking snapshots in time, or within greedy algorithms for sampling parameter space.",10.1002/nme.5283,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nme.5283

In this case, the errors caused by parametric inversion and interpolation in variables transfer to the new mesh can be as large as the gradient components. This paper presents an efficient modified finite difference approach that allows remeshing either in path-independent or path-dependent problems, not being affected by the aforementioned errors. The strategy to cope with remeshing is extensive to the semi-analytical method which, for non-linear analyses, is shown to be a particular case of the proposed finite difference sensitivity approach. With this implementation, the finite difference, the semi-analytical and the analytical sensitivity methods all have comparable computational costs.

It can be used as an alternative to developing more intricate physically based models. Furthermore, alternating point processes can be used to generate synthetic data that may reveal useful for analysis purposes. Most importantly, they allow to subsequently quantify risks related to deficit durations.

Due to the curse of dimensionality, the underlying dependence relationships between these random variables are difficult to capture. In this work, a probabilistic graphical model based approach is employed to learn the dependence by running a number of conditional independence tests using observation data. Thus a probabilistic model of the joint PDF is obtained and the PDF is factorized into a set of conditional distributions based on the dependence structure of the variables. The estimation of the joint PDF from data is then transformed to estimating conditional distributions under reduced dimensions. To improve the computational efficiency, a polynomial chaos expansion is further applied to represent the random field in terms of a set of standard random variables.

Due to chemical weathering, karst systems are characterized by strong heterogeneity resulting in a complex flow and storage behaviour. Presently available karst modelling strategies account for the karstic heterogeneity but often a lack of data limits their applicability in data-scarce regions. In this study, a step-wise simulation approach with a semi-distributed karst model is proposed to characterize a karst aquifer at a data-scarce region in Southwest Iran and to evaluate the leakage potential related to a future dam construction project at a river that cuts through the aquifer. Observed groundwater level time series were applied to calibrate and validate the model. In order to avoid over-parameterization, the karst aquifer was split into three sections down the hydraulic gradient. At each section, groundwater level observations were used to iteratively calibrate the model from the first to the last section. A spatial split sample test and sensitivity analysis served to evaluate the prediction performance and the identifiability of the model parameters. Finally, simple scenarios of the river infiltration into the aquifer were applied to evaluate the leakage potential of the aquifer for future dam constructions. The spatial split-sample test showed that the semi-distributed model provided reliable predictions but prediction performance and parameter identifiability decreased from the first towards the last aquifer section, most probably due to increased aquifer complexity and propagation of uncertainty from the up-gradient model section. Using sensitivity analysis, we also show that parameter sensitivities increase significantly if parameter estimation was applied simultaneously to all three aquifer subsections. Using the model to assess the leakage potential indicated that, without further technical measures, the all river flow would be able infiltrate into the aquifer and the dam would never be filled up completely.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.08.056,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.08.056

Because all models are simplifications of complex systems, there will exist an inherent amount of uncertainty associated with their predictions. It is therefore important that efforts be directed at identifying, quantifying, and communicating the different sources of model uncertainties. In this study, we conducted an uncertainty analysis with the Annual P Loss Estimator (APLE) model. Our analysis included calculating parameter uncertainties and confidence and prediction intervals for five internal regression equations in APLE. We also estimated uncertainties of the model input variables based on values reported in the literature. We then predicted P loss for a suite of fields under different management and climatic conditions while accounting for uncertainties in the model parameters and inputs and compared the relative contributions of these two sources of uncertainty to the overall uncertainty associated with predictions of P loss. Both the overall magnitude of the prediction uncertainties and the relative contributions of the two sources of uncertainty varied depending on management practices and field characteristics. This was due to differences in the number of model input variables and the uncertainties in the regression equations associated with each P loss pathway. Inspection of the uncertainties in the five regression equations brought attention to a previously unrecognized limitation with the equation used to partition surface-applied fertilizer P between leaching and runoff losses. As a result, an alternate equation was identified that provided similar predictions with much less uncertainty.

Wellbore storage at the source and observation wells is accounted for using an approximate superposition technique.

Storage values were not found to be uniquely determined with this method. Several field examples are presented in order to validate the applicability of the analysis to real data. The effects of the connection to the water table through double porosity were found to be significant, resulting in an observation well response that cannot be simulated using a single porosity model.

Many multi-scale methods, which couple molecular dynamics models with continuum models, have been proposed over the last decade. One of the most advanced methods developed recently is the bridging scale method, in which the total displacement is decomposed into orthogonal coarse and fine scales. This paper presents the continuum-based sensitivity analysis for two-dimensional coupled atomistic and continuum problems using the bridging scale method. A variational formulation for the bridging scale decomposition is developed based on the Hamilton's principle. The continuum-based variational formulation provides a uniform and generalized system of equations from which the differential equations can be obtained naturally. The sensitivity expressions for both direct differentiation method (DDM) and adjoint variable method (AVM) are derived in a continuum setting. Due to its efficiency for crack problems, the direct differentiation method is chosen to be implemented numerically and applied to two examples, including a crack propagation problem. Both material and sizing design variables are included to reveal the impact of design changes at the macroscopic level to the responses at the atomistic level. Also demonstrated is the feasibility of achieving the variation of the time history kernel computed using numerical procedures.

It is therefore presented before specific use in optimization examples. The engineering approach of fully stressed design is a practical tool with a theoretical foundation. The analog approach to structural eigenfrequency optimization is presented here with its theoretical foundation. A numerical heuristic redesign procedure is proposed and illustrated with examples. For the ideal case, an optimality criterion is fulfilled if the design have the same sub-domain frequency (local Rayleigh quotient). Sensitivity analysis shows an important relation between squared system eigenfrequency and squared local sub-domain frequency for a given eigen-mode. Higher order eigenfrequencies may also be controlled in this manner.

Uncertainty propagation is an expensive process, but robust solutions can be obtained more easily when the disciplines affected by uncertainties have a significant effect on the objectives of the problem. A heuristic method based on local uncertainty processing (LOUP) is presented here, allowing approximate solving of specific robust optimization problems with minor changes in the initial multidisciplinary system. Uncertainty is processed within the disciplines that it impacts directly, without propagation to the other disciplines. A criterion to verify a posteriori the applicability of the method to a given multidisciplinary system is provided. The LOUP method is applied to an aircraft preliminary design industrial test case, in which it allowed to obtain robust designs whose performance is more stable than the one of deterministic solutions, relatively to uncertain parameter variations.",10.1007/s00158-012-0798-0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00158-012-0798-0

However, monitoring the spatial and temporal dynamics of snow in such mountainous environments remains rather challenging. We therefore developed a snow depth meter using small temperature loggers. Small temperature loggers were attached to poles at  cm intervals from the ground surface. Snow depths were estimated by assessing the daily variations in temperatures. Using this snow depth meter, we continuously observed snow depths at  stations in a forested catchment in Japan over three winter seasons. Using correlation analysis, we then analyzed the influence of topography (i.e., elevation and aspect) and forest (i.e., canopy openness) on snow depths. Moreover, we estimated daily snow distributions in the area using multi-regression analysis, thus describing seasonal characteristics of snow distributions. Finally we investigated the relation between number of stations and estimation accuracies of snow distributions using a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis. We observed that the influence of topographical and forest characteristics changed considerably during the study period, with elevation having a major impact on snow depths. Further, aspect and forest cover had a great influence on the snow depths during the melting period. The regression of elevation slopes was .-. mm/m during rich snow years and .-. mm/m in little snow years. Also, the snow distribution during the melting period was found to be less uniform than during the snow accumulation period using histograms of snow depths. Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis shows that one station per .-. ha is enough to estimate accurate snow distributions. Given the above, we concluded that our proposed approach was quite useful for investigating the influence of topography and forest characteristics on snow accumulation and melting.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.01.021,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.01.021

As a complement to the recently published EMFX model, a method based on two specific suction conditions is proposed to estimate saturated film conductivity from the soil water retention curve. This method reduces one fitting parameter in the previous EMFX model, making it possible to predict the hydraulic conductivity from the soil water retention curve over the complete moisture range. Model performance is evaluated with published data of soils in a broad texture range from sand to clay. The testing results indicate that ) the modified EMFX model (namely the EMFX-K model), incorporating both capillary and adsorption forces, provides good agreement with the conductivity data over the entire moisture range; ) a value of . for the tortuosity factor in the EMFX-K model as that in the Mualem's model gives comparable estimation of the relative conductivity associated with the capillary force; and ) a value of . x (-) J for the Hamaker constant, rather than the commonly used value of . x (-) J, appears to be more appropriate to represent solely the effect of the van der Waals forces and to predict the film conductivity. In comparison with the commonly used van Genuchten-Mualem model, the EMFX-K model significantly improves the prediction of hydraulic conductivity under dry conditions. The sensitivity analysis result suggests that the uncertainty in the film thickness estimation is important in explaining the model underestimation of hydraulic conductivity for the soils with fine texture, in addition to the uncertainties from the measurements and the model structure.

Previous studies on fully integrated solute transport focus on small scales, simple geometric domains, and have not utilised many different field data sources. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the inclusion of both flow and solute transport in a D, fully integrated catchment model, utilising high resolution observations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export from a wetland complex during a rainfall event. A sensitivity analysis is performed to span a range of transport conditions for the surface-subsurface boundary (e.g. advective exchange only, advection plus diffusion, advection plus full mechanical dispersion) and subsurface dispersivities. The catchment model captures some aspects of observed catchment behaviour (e.g. solute discharge at the catchment outlet, increasing discharge from wetlands with increased stream discharge, and counter-clockwise concentration-discharge relationships), although other known behaviours are not well represented in the model (e.g. slope of concentration-discharge plots). Including surface-subsurface solute transport aids in evaluating internal model processes, however there are challenges related to the influence of dispersion across the surface-subsurface interface, and non-uniqueness of the solute transport solution.

In particular, the MHD kinematics equations can be used to simulate the magnetic field induced by a given velocity field. While prescribing the velocity field leads to a simpler model than the fully coupled MHD system, this may introduce some epistemic uncertainty into the model. If the velocity of a physical system is not known with certainty, the magnetic field obtained from the model may not be reflective of the magnetic field seen in experiments. Additionally, uncertainty in physical parameters such as the magnetic resistivity may affect the reliability of predictions obtained from this model. By modeling the velocity and the resistivity as random variables in the MHD kinematics model, we seek to quantify the effects of uncertainty in these fields on the induced magnetic field. We develop stochastic expressions for these quantities and investigate their impact within a finite element discretization of the kinematics equations. We obtain mean and variance data through Monte Carlo simulation for several test problems.

A correction method previously used in wire-based electromagnetics is applied to address convergence issues associated with the singularity of the thermal solution along the microchannels. The numerical solution is obtained with the interface-enriched generalized finite element method (IGFEM), which greatly simplifies mesh generation by allowing for the use of a non-conforming mesh to capture the temperature gradient discontinuity across the microchannels. The temperature distribution calculated with the IGFEM on coarse meshes agrees with that obtained using significantly more complex and costly ANSYS FLUENT simulations. We then combine the IGFEM with a sensitivity analysis and the sequential quadratic programming algorithm in MATLAB to solve two sets of shape optimization problems related to actively cooled microvascular composite panels. These problems demonstrate a key advantage of the IGFEM in avoiding severe mesh distoition during shape optimization.

The accurate representation of the evolution of a discontinuous stochastic solution over time requires a large number of stochastic basis functions. Adaptivity of the stochastic basis to reduce computational cost is challenging in the stochastic Galerkin setting since the change of basis affects the system matrix itself.

The moments in the moment equations are approximated over a simplified domain that is homeomorphic to the original domain, and then are corrected for the deviation from the original domain using shape sensitivity analysis. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of AW integration scheme in the context of the Finite Cell Method which must perform numerical integration over arbitrary domains without meshing. The standard integration technique employed in FCM is the characteristic function method that converts the continuous integrand over a complex domain into a discontinuous integrand over a simple (box) domain. Then, well known integrand adaptivity techniques are employed to integrate the resulting discontinuous integrand over the box domain. Although this method is simple to implement, it becomes computationally very expensive for realistic complex D domains such as sculptures, bones and engines. In contrast, in AW scheme the quadrature weights directly adapt to the complex geometric domain without the need to making the integrand discontinuous leading to superior computational properties. In this paper, we demonstrate the computational efficiency of AW over the characteristic function method as it requires fewer subdivisions and less time to achieve a given accuracy in both two and three dimensions.

We show how these characters can be used as indications on the aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. In the case of large dimensional parameter spaces, these characterizations are established for quantile-based extreme scenarios and a multi-point moment-based sensitivity direction permits to propose a directional uncertainty quantification concept for directional extreme scenarios (DES).

This is reasonable so long as one can interpolate properties for such materials and so long as the final design is integer valued. For this purpose, we present a method for smoothly thresholding the volume fractions of an arbitrary number of material phases which specify the design. This method is trivial for two-material design problems, for example, the canonical topology design problem of specifying the presence or absence of a single material within a domain, but it becomes more complex when three or more materials are used, as often occurs in material design problems. We take advantage of the similarity in properties between the volume fractions and the barycentric coordinates on a simplex to derive a thresholding, method which is applicable to an arbitrary number of materials.

Recently, a physics-based nonparametric approach for quantifying model-form uncertainty in RANS simulations has been proposed, where Reynolds stresses are projected to physically meaningful dimensions and perturbations are introduced only in the physically realizable limits (Xiao et al., ). However, a challenge associated with this approach is to assess the amount of information introduced in the prior distribution and to avoid imposing unwarranted constraints. In this work we propose a random matrix approach for quantifying model-form uncertainties in RANS simulations with the realizability of the Reynolds stress guaranteed, which is achieved by construction from the Cholesky factorization of the normalized Reynolds stress tensor. Furthermore, the maximum entropy principle is used to identify the probability distribution that satisfies the constraints from available information but without introducing artificial constraints. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to ensure the realizability of the Reynolds stress, albeit in a different manner from the physics-based approach. Monte Carlo sampling of the obtained probability distribution is achieved by using polynomial chaos expansion to map independent Gaussian random fields to the Reynolds stress random field with the marginal distributions and correlation structures as specified. Numerical simulations on a typical flow with separation have shown physically reasonable results, which verify the proposed approach. Therefore, the proposed method is a promising alternative to the physics-based approach for model-form uncertainty quantification of RANS simulations.

In the present study, we focus on determining the effective properties of heterogeneous porous media at the Darcy scale with an analysis of their uncertainties. Preliminary, experimental measurements of the hydraulic properties of each component of the heterogeneous medium are obtained. The properties of the effective medium, representing an equivalent homogeneous material, are determined numerically by simulating a water flow in a three-dimensional representation of the heterogeneous medium, under steady-state scenarios and using its component properties. One of the major aspects of this study is to take into account the uncertainties of these properties in the computation and evaluation of the effective properties. This is done using a bootstrap method. Numerical evaporation experiments are conducted both on the heterogeneous and on the effective homogeneous materials to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. First, the impact of the uncertainties of the component properties on the simulated water matric potential is found to be high for the heterogeneous material configuration. Second, it is shown that the strategy developed herein leads to a reduction of this impact. Finally, the adequacy between the mean of the simulations for the two configurations confirms the suitability of the homogenization approach, even in the case of dynamic scenarios.

By using these variables in the Taylor expansions of the constraints, a corresponding general first order reliability method (FORM) based quadratic programming (QP) problem is formulated and solved in the standard normal space. The MPP is found in the physical space in the metric of Hasofer-Lind by using a Newton algorithm, where the efficiency of the Newton method is obtained by introducing an inexact Jacobian and a line-search of Armijo type. The FORM-based SQP approach is then corrected by applying four SORM approaches: Breitung, Hohenbichler, Tvedt and a recent suggested formula. The proposed SORM-based SQP approach for RBDO is accurate, efficient and robust. This is demonstrated by solving several established benchmarks, with values on the target of reliability that are considerable higher than what is commonly used, for mixtures of five different distributions (normal, lognormal, Gumbel, gamma and Weibull). Established benchmarks are also generalized in order to study problems with large number of variables and several constraints.

The main objective is to consider the impact of weight over tip clearance performance criterion and see how these two objectives are antagonistic. In this work, we perform in the same design session tasks traditionally devoted to the airframe manufacturer and aero-engine manufacturer. The overall weight of the assembly is minimized with respect to Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) criterion. One interesting aspect of the process is that SFC criterion is based on highly proprietary models and its simulation and call within an optimization process is made available through the development of a webservice. One major phenomenon to consider in both pylon and engine design is Fan Blade Off (FBO) event, i.e. the sudden release of a blade. This event causes high impact loads and must be considered carefully in the design. Such a simulation is not an easy task and several nonlinear phenomena must be addressed (e.g. rotordynamics), not to mention the integration of this nonlinear dynamic response in a static structural optimization process.

"Van Buren, KL | Hemez, FM",2016,Achieving robust design through statistical effect screening,Applications_INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING,2,1.0,"This work proposes a method for statistical effect screening to identify design parameters of a numerical simulation that are influential to performance while simultaneously being robust to epistemic uncertainty introduced by calibration variables. Design parameters are controlled by the analyst, but the optimal design is often uncertain, while calibration variables are introduced by modeling choices. We argue that uncertainty introduced by design parameters and calibration variables should be treated differently, despite potential interactions between the two sets. Herein, a robustness criterion is embedded in our effect screening to guarantee the influence of design parameters, irrespective of values used for calibration variables. The Morris screening method is utilized to explore the design space, while robustness to uncertainty is quantified in the context of info-gap decision theory. The proposed method is applied to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Multidisciplinary Uncertainty Quantification Challenge Problem, which is a black-box code for aeronautic flight guidance that requires  input parameters. The application demonstrates that a large number of variables can be handled without formulating simplifying assumptions about the potential coupling between calibration variables and design parameters. Because of the computational efficiency of the Morris screening method, we conclude that the analysis can be applied to even larger-dimensional problems.

To perform the optimization, a simple linear system composed of an input force vector, an output displacement vector and a matrix connecting them is constructed in the context of a discretized linear elasticity problem using FEM. By adding two constraints: , the dimensions of the input and the output vectors are equal; , the Euclidean norms of all local input force vectors are constant; from the singular value decomposition of the matrix connecting the input force vector and the output displacement vector, the optimization problem, which specifies and equalizes the norms of all output vectors, is formulated. It is a minimization problem of the weighted summation of the condition number of the matrix and the least square error of the second singular value and the specified value. This methodology is implemented as a topology optimization problem using the solid isotropic material with penalization method, sensitivity analysis and method of moving asymptotes.

Such an issue can arise in uncertainty quantification when only a limited amount of data is available. When the available information does not suffice to accurately determine the probability distributions that must be assigned to the uncertain variables, the Bayesian method for assigning these probability distributions becomes attractive because it allows the stochastic model to account explicitly for insufficiency of the available information. In previous work, such applications of the Bayesian method had already been implemented by using the Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. In this paper, we present an alternative implementation, which uses an alternative MCMC method built around an Ito stochastic differential equation (SDE) that is ergodic for the Bayesian posterior. We draw together from the mathematics literature a number of formal properties of this Ito SDE that lend support to its use in the implementation of the Bayesian method, and we describe its discretization, including the choice of the free parameters, by using the implicit Euler method.

A discontinuity in random space makes the application of generalized polynomial chaos expansion techniques prohibitively expensive. The reason is that for discontinuous problems, the expansion converges very slowly. An alternative to using higher terms in the expansion is to divide the random space in smaller elements where a lower degree polynomial is adequate to describe the randomness. In general, the partition of the random space is a dynamic process since some areas of the random space, particularly around the discontinuity, need more refinement than others as time evolves. In the current work we propose a way to decide when and where to refine the random space mesh based on the use of a reduced model. The idea is that a good reduced model can monitor accurately, within a random space element, the cascade of activity to higher degree terms in the chaos expansion. In turn, this facilitates the efficient allocation of computational sources to the areas of random space where they are more needed. For the Kraichnan Orszag system, the prototypical system to study discontinuities in random space, we present theoretical results which show why the proposed method is sound and numerical results which corroborate the theory.",10.1016/j.jcp.2014.09.021,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2014.09.021

The method provides an automatic design tool by optimizing an objective function subject to the standard geometric and code constraints, and two more sets of constraints, that guarantee some given safety factors and failure probability bounds, associated with a given set of failure modes. Since a direct solution of the optimization problem is not possible, the method proceeds as a sequence of three steps: (a) an optimal classical design, based on given safety factors, is done, (b) failure probabilities or bounds of all failure modes are calculated, and (c) safety factors bounds are adjusted. This implies a double safety check that leads to safer structures and designs less prone to wrong or unrealistic probability assumptions, and to excessively small (unsafe) or large (costly) safety factors. Finally, the actual global or combined probabilities of the different failure modes and their correlation are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is performed. To this end, the optimization problems are transformed into another equivalent ones, in which the data parameters are converted into artificial variables.

In this article, we present two non-traditional methods that utilize the static determinacy to compute the membrane stress. A common theme is to start with a deformed configuration and use artificial material models. In one of these approaches, the equilibrium problem is formulated as an inverse elastostatic problem whereby the stress is determined by way of finding a (fictitious) reference configuration. The other approach utilizes the standard forward analysis, but in a penalty setting using artificially stiff material models. A continuum sensitivity analysis is implemented to quantitatively assess the influence of material parameters.

The number of second-order motion differential equations equals the number of DOFs, that is, there is one differential equation per independent acceleration. The dynamic equations are then differentiated with respect to the parameters by using automatic differentiation and without manual intervention from the user. By adding the sensitivity equations to the dynamic equations, the forward dynamics and the independent sensitivities can be robustly computed using standard integrators.

The specifications of suitable damage functions for the developed method are investigated, and an efficient damage function is introduced. A sensitivity analysis of numerical input parameters is performed, which proves that the model is not sensitive to the length of the damage band. Because the required element size is linked to the length of the damage band, the insensitivity to this length provides freedom to use coarser meshes.

This is shown to be always possible, by a lemma depending primarily on Caratheodory's theorem. The resulting one-dimensional rules can be used within a Smolyak procedure to produce sparse multi-dimensional rules, but weight positivity is lost then. As a remedy, the reduction procedure is directly applied to multidimensional tensor-product cubature rules. This allows to produce a family of sparse cubature rules with positive weights, competitive with Smolyak rules. Finally the positivity constraint is relaxed to allow more flexibility in the removal of nodes. This gives a second family of sparse cubature rules, in which iteratively as many nodes as possible are removed.

The TCE model is used to convert Arrhenius-form reaction rate constants into reaction cross-sections, after modification to allow accurate modeling of reactions with arbitrarily large rates relative to the VHS collision rate. The square of the Pearson correlation coefficient was used as the measure for sensitivity in the first of the analyses, and the mutual information was used as the measure in the second. The quantity of interest (QoI) for these analyses was the NO density profile across a D shock at similar to  m/s (M-infinity approximate to ). This vector QoI was broken into a set of scalar QoIs, each representing the density of NO at a specific point downstream of the shock, and sensitivities were calculated for each scalar QoI based on both measures of sensitivity. Profiles of sensitivity vs. location downstream of the shock were then integrated to determine an overall sensitivity for each reaction. A weighting function was used in the integration in order to emphasize sensitivities in the region of greatest thermal and chemical non-equilibrium. Both sensitivity analysis methods agree on the six reactions which most strongly affect the density of NO.

The proposed method, termed the transformed path integral (TPI) method, utilizes a new formulation for the underlying short-time propagator to perform the evolution of the probability density function (PDF) in a transformed computational domain where a more accurate representation of the PDF can be ensured. The new formulation, based on a dynamic transformation of the original state space with the statistics of the PDF as parameters, preserves the non-negativity of the PDF and incorporates short-time properties of the underlying stochastic process. New update equations for the state PDF in a transformed space and the parameters of the transformation (including mean and covariance) that better accommodate nonlinearities in drift and non-Gaussian behavior in distributions are proposed (based on properties of the SDE). Owing to the choice of transformation considered, the proposed method maps a fixed grid in transformed space to a dynamically adaptive grid in the original state space. The TPI method, in contrast to conventional methods such as Monte Carlo simulations and fixed grid approaches, is able to better represent the distributions (especially the tail information) and better address challenges in processes with large diffusion, large drift and large concentration of PDF. Additionally, in the proposed TPI method, error bounds on the probability in the computational domain can be obtained using the Chebyshev's inequality. The benefits of the TPI method over conventional methods are illustrated through simulations of linear and nonlinear drift processes in one-dimensional and multidimensional state spaces. The effects of spatial and temporal grid resolutions as well as that of the diffusion coefficient on the error in the PDF are also characterized.",10.1016/j.jcp.2017.06.002,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2017.06.002

However, structural optimization has been developed based on static responses because sensitivity analysis regarding static finite element analysis is developed quite well. Analyses other than static analysis are heavily required in the engineering community these days. Techniques for such analyses have been extensively developed and many software systems using the finite element method are easily available in the market. On the other hand, development of structural optimization using such analyses is fairly slow due to many obstacles. One obstacle is that it is very difficult and expensive to consider the nonlinearities or dynamic effects in the way of conventional optimization. Recently, the equivalent static loads method for non linear static response structural optimization (ESLSO) has been proposed for structural optimization with various responses: linear dynamic response, nonlinear static response, and nonlinear dynamic response. In ESLSO, finite element analysis other than static analysis is performed, equivalent static loads (ESLs) are generated, linear static response structural optimization is carried out with the ESLs and the process iterates. A software system for the automatic use of ESLSO is developed and described. One of the advantages of ESLSO is that it can use well developed commercial software systems for structural analysis and linear static response structural optimization. Various analysis and optimization systems are integrated in the developed system.

As a result, our proposed method provides an approximation hierarchy for the solution as we increase the number of terms in the expansion and, also, increase the spatial resolution of each term.

One objective of this paper is to discuss the possible formulations of design problems in this type of uncertain context. By considering uncertainties in the constraint and/or objective functions underlying design problems, several design strategies might in fact be implemented. Especially, this paper should contribute to clarifying the use of the concepts of robustness and reliability in design. After an introduction, the featured design strategies are illustrated and discussed via three academic examples which involve multiple random and design variables.

We assess the error in hypothetical stratified formations by numerical sensitivity analysis, and propose an effective method for compensation by incorporating two types of casing configuration (piezometer and tube). The hypothetical stratified formation consists of completely horizontal layers, each I m thick; the permeability is different between, but not within, layers. In this study, conductivity estimates in the piezometer and tube methods are calculated by assigning various patterns of conductivity to the test, upper, and lower layers: K-T, K-U and K-L. The effect of vertical flow becomes significant when K-T is small relative to K-U or K-L, and K-L is more important than K-U because the base of the borehole is open to the lower formation. The conductivity ratios (estimate over actual value) are treated as approximately linearly dependent on logarithms of K-T/K-U and K-T/K-L, so that conductivity estimates can be straightforwardly derived from one piezometer measurement and two tube measurements at the top and bottom of the screen. The linear relations are evaluated and constant parameters are determined under specific conditions. This study also recommends alternating piezometer and tube methods in the drilling procedure because the actual variation of K with depth is larger than that found using isolated measurements, as shown in a field study of alluvial fan gravel deposits in Sapporo, Japan.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.06.019,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.06.019

The suitability of this technique has been assessed and demonstrated for a wide range of engineering applications without geometric shape constraints. In this contribution, a consistent formulation is presented for the implementation of numerous point-wise geometric constraints in four main steps. First, a potential contact between optimization surface points and the bounding surface is identified via the so-called gap function. Second, the shape gradients of objective functions and active constraints are mapped onto the Vertex Morphing's control space, where the optimization problem is formulated. Third, the linear least squares method is used to project the steepest-descent search direction onto the subspace tangent to the mapped active constraints.

To minimize cutting scrap and to ensure that this shape satisfies the required tolerances as precisely as possible, we formulate an optimal control problem where we use the trajectories of the rolls as control functions. The deformation of the solid body is described through the basic equations of nonlinear continuum mechanics, which are here coupled with an elasto-viscoplastic material model based on a multiplicative split of the deformation gradient. We assume that the deformations of the rolls can be neglected, thus we add unilateral frictional contact boundary conditions, resulting in an evolutionary quasi-variational inclusion. The associated control-to-observation map is non-differentiable due to changes of state between elastic and plastic material behavior, contact and separation and stick and slip motion, yet we still want to apply gradient-based methods to solve the optimal control problem and therefore have to make sure that derivatives of cost functional and constraints exist.

Surrogates of the aerodynamic loads are used to increase robustness and reduce the number of costly high-fidelity simulations necessary during trim simulations. This is accomplished in two steps: () by finding a suitable estimate for the solution by global and fast local searches performed on surrogates, and () by applying a hybrid local search to check the potential solution and to further increase its quality if necessary. For the local searches in both steps, a Newton method is employed, whereas a genetic algorithm is used only in the first step. For the Newton method, the entries of the Jacobian are provided by means of finite difference approximations and the complex-step derivative method (CSD) based on the surrogates, and it is shown how to make CSD applicable to surrogates based on radial basis functions (RBFs). In the hybrid search, the derivatives are calculated by means of surrogates, while high-fidelity simulations are used for the main calculations of the Newton method. Updating the surrogates with the results of the latter is found to significantly accelerate the convergence of the hybrid local search. The methodology is applied to challenging trim test cases, in which several of the control surfaces of a generic fighter aircraft are deflected during trim simulation. Control surface deflection is performed via RBF-based mesh deformation, and RBFs are also used for surrogate modeling, thereby fostering code modularity and re-use.",10.1016/j.cma.2012.01.010,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2012.01.010

However, calibration of the agricultural-hydrological system models is challenging because of model complexity, the existence of strong parameter correlation, and significant computational requirements. Therefore, only a limited number of simulations can be allowed in any attempt to find a near-optimal solution within an affordable time, which greatly restricts the successful application of the model. The goal of this study is to locate the optimal solution of the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) given a limited simulation time, so as to improve the model simulation and help make rational and effective agricultural-hydrological decisions. To this end, we propose a computationally efficient global optimization procedure using sparse-grid based surrogates. We first used advanced sparse grid (SG) interpolation to construct a surrogate system of the actual RZWQM, and then we calibrate the surrogate model using the global optimization algorithm, Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO). As the surrogate model is a polynomial with fast evaluation, it can be efficiently evaluated with a sufficiently large number of times during the optimization, which facilitates the global search. We calibrate seven model parameters against five years of yield, drain flow, and NO-N loss data from a subsurface-drained corn-soybean field in Iowa. Results indicate that an accurate surrogate model can be created for the RZWQM with a relatively small number of SG points (i.e., RZWQM runs).

The key idea of MLMC is that one can draw MC samples simultaneously and independently on several approximations of the problem under investigations on a hierarchy of nested computational grids (levels). The expectation of an output quantity is computed as a sample average using the coarsest solutions and corrected by averages of the differences of the solutions of two consecutive grids in the hierarchy. By this way, most of the computational effort is transported from the finest level (as in a standard Monte Carlo approach) to the coarsest one. The continuation algorithm (C-MLMC) is a robust and self-tuning version that estimates on the fly the optimal number of level and realizations per level. In this work we describe in detail how C-MLMC can be adapted to perform uncertainty quantification analysis in compressible aerodynamics and we apply it to the relevant test cases of a quasi D convergent-divergent Laval nozzle and the D transonic RAE- airfoil.",10.1016/j.cma.2017.07.030,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2017.07.030
"Diez, P | Zlotnik, S | Huerta, A",2017,Generalized parametric solutions in Stokes flow,Applications_COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING,0,0.0,"Design optimization and uncertainty quantification, among other applications of industrial interest, require fast or multiple queries of some parametric model. The Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) provides a separable solution, a computational vademecum explicitly dependent on the parameters, efficiently computed with a greedy algorithm combined with an alternated directions scheme and compactly stored. This strategy has been successfully employed in many problems in computational mechanics. The application to problems with saddle point structure raises some difficulties requiring further attention. This article proposes a PGD formulation of the Stokes problem. Various possibilities of the separated forms of the PGD solutions are discussed and analyzed, selecting the more viable option. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is demonstrated in numerical examples for both Stokes and Brinkman models.",10.1016/j.cma.2017.07.016,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2017.07.016
"Funke, SW | Farrell, PE | Piggott, MD",2017,Reconstructing wave profiles from inundation data,Applications_COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING,0,0.0,"This paper applies variational data assimilation to inundation problems governed by the shallow water equations with wetting and drying. The objective of the assimilation is to recover an unknown time-varying wave profile at an open ocean boundary from inundation observations. This problem is solved with derivative-based optimisation and an adjoint wetting and drying scheme to efficiently compute sensitivity information. The capabilities of this approach are demonstrated on an idealised sloping beach setup in which the profile of an incoming wave is reconstructed from wet/dry interface observations. The method is robust to noise in the observations if a regularisation term is added to the optimisation objective. Finally, the method is applied to a laboratory experiment of the Hokkaido-Nansei-Oki tsunami, where the wave profile is reconstructed with a relative L-infinity error of less than %.",10.1016/j.cma.2017.04.019,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2017.04.019

In the proposed method, non-uniform rational B-splines are used to parameterize the design geometry precisely and compactly by a small number of design variables. An analytical shape sensitivity analysis is developed to compute derivatives of the objective and constraint functions with respect to the design variables. Subtle but important new terms involve the sensitivity of shape functions and their spatial derivatives. Verification and illustrative problems are solved to demonstrate the precision and capability of the method.",10.1002/nme.5482,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nme.5482
"Zaicenco, AG",2017,Sparse collocation method for global sensitivity analysis and calculation of statistics of solutions in SPDEs,Applications_INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING,0,0.0,"This paper explores advantages offered by the stochastic collocation method based on the Smolyak grids for the solution of differential equations with random inputs in the parameter space. We use sparse Smolyak grids and the Chebyshev polynomials to construct multidimensional basis and approximate decoupled stochastic differential equations via interpolation. Disjoint set of grid points and basis functions allow us to gain significant improvement to conventional Smolyak algorithm. Density function and statistical moments of the solution are obtained by means of quadrature rules if inputs are uncorrelated and uniformly distributed. Otherwise, the Monte Carlo analysis can run inexpensively using obtained sparse approximation. An adaptive technique to sample from a multivariate density function using sparse grid is proposed to reduce the number of required sampling points. Global sensitivity analysis is viewed as an extension of the sparse interpolant construction and is performed by means of the Sobol' variance-based or the Kullback-Leibler entropy methods identifying the degree of contribution from the individual inputs as well as the cross terms.",10.1002/nme.5454,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nme.5454
"Lee, W",2014,Adaptive approximation of higher order posterior statistics,Applications_JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS,0,0.0,"Filtering is an approach for incorporating observed data into time-evolving systems. Instead of a family of Dirac delta masses that is widely used in Monte Carlo methods, we here use the Wiener chaos expansion for the parametrization of the conditioned probability distribution to solve the nonlinear filtering problem. The Wiener chaos expansion is not the best method for uncertainty propagation without observations. Nevertheless, the projection of the system variables in a fixed polynomial basis spanning the probability space might be a competitive representation in the presence of relatively frequent observations because the Wiener chaos approach not only leads to an accurate and efficient prediction for short time uncertainty quantification, but it also allows to apply several data assimilation methods that can be used to yield a better approximate filtering solution. The aim of the present paper is to investigate this hypothesis. We answer in the affirmative for the (stochastic) Lorenz- system based on numerical simulations in which the uncertainty quantification method and the data assimilation method are adaptively selected by whether the dynamics is driven by Brownian motion and the near-Gaussianity of the measure to be updated, respectively.",10.1016/j.jcp.2013.11.015,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2013.11.015
"Qiu, HC | Qiu, ZP",2017,A modified stochastic perturbation algorithm for closely-spaced eigenvalues problems based on surrogate model,Applications_STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION,0,0.0,"Aiming at uncertainty propagation and dynamic reanalysis of closely-spaced eigenvalues, with consideration of uncertainties in design variables, a modified stochastic perturbation method is proposed. Concerning quasi-symmetric or partial-symmetric structures that frequently appear, one of their primary features is closely-distributed natural frequencies. For structure with closely-spaced eigenvalues, due to its instability and sensitivity to the changes of design variables and its excessively concentrated adjacent eigenvalues, conventional uncertainty analysis or dynamic reanalysis methods for distinct eigenvalue are no longer available. Initially, the spectral decompositions of stiffness and mass matrices are provided; by transfer technique, the eigen-problem of closely-spaced eigenvalues is converted to that of repeated eigenvalues with two perturbation parts appended; then the perturbed closely-spaced eigenvalue is rewritten as the sum of original closely-spaced eigenvalues' mean value and surrogate model which approximates the first-order perturbation term by polynomial chaos expansions. According to this method, statistical quantities of perturbed closely-spaced eigenvalues are calculated directly and accurately, which contributes to its uncertainty analysis and dynamic reanalysis. Furthermore, the capability of proposed method in dealing with relatively large uncertainties and complex engineering structure is demonstrated. The accuracy and efficiency of proposed method have been verified sufficiently by numerical examples.",10.1007/s00158-017-1660-1,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00158-017-1660-1
