The scenario studied is that of a complex street canyon in the city of York, UK. The sensitivity of the turbulence and mean flow fields to the input parameters is detailed both at specific measurement points and in the associated canyon cross-section to aid comparison with field data. This analysis gives insight into how model parameters can influence the predicted outputs. It also shows the relative strength of each parameter in its influence. Four main input parameters are addressed. Three parameters are surface roughness lengths, determining the flow over a surface, and the fourth is the background wind direction. In order to determine the relative importance of each parameter, sensitivity indices are calculated for the canyon cross-section. The sensitivity of the flow structures in and above the canyon to each parameter is found to be very location dependant. In general, at a particular measurement point, it is the closest wall surface that is most influential on the model output. However, due to the complexity of the flow at different wind angles this is not always the case, for example when a recirculating canyon flow pattern is present. The background wind direction is shown to be an important parameter as it determines the surface features encountered by the flow. The accuracy with which this is specified when modelling a full-scale situation is therefore an important consideration when considering model uncertainty. Overall, the uncertainty due to roughness lengths is small in comparison to the mean outputs, indicating that the model is well defined even with large ranges of input parameter uncertainty.

Frequently, the underlying laws governing this dependence are not known and one has to interpolate the mathematical model from a finite number of output samples. Multivariate approximation is normally viewed as suffering from the curse of dimensionality as the number of sample points needed to learn the function to a sufficient accuracy increases exponentially with the dimensionality of the function. However, the outputs of most physical systems are mathematically. well behaved and the scarcity of the data is usually compensated for by additional assumptions on the function (i.e., imposition of smoothness conditions or confinement to a specific function space). High dimensional model representations (HDMR) are a particular family of representations where each term in the representation reflects the individual or cooperative contributions of the inputs upon the output. The main assumption of this paper is that for most well defined physical systems the output can be approximated by the sum of these hierarchical functions whose dimensionality is much smaller than the dimensionality of the output. This ansatz can dramatically reduce the sampling effort in representing the multivariate, function. HDMR has a variety of applications where an efficient representation of multivariate functions arise with scarce data. The formulation of HDMR in this paper assumes that the data is randomly scattered throughout the domain of the output. Under these conditions and the assumptions underlying the HDMR it is argued that the number of samples needed for representation to a given tolerance is invariant to the dimensionality of the function, thereby providing for a very efficient means to perform high dimensional interpolation. Selected applications of HDMR's are presented from sensitivity analysis and time-series analysis.",,WOS:000170079400003,SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS REGRESSION KINETICS OUTPUT,Efficient implementation of high dimensional model representations,2001

In practice, the HDMR component functions are each approximated by an appropriate basis function expansion. This procedure often requires many input-output samples which can restrict the treatment of high dimensional systems. In order to address this problem we introduce svr-based HDMR to efficiently and effectively construct the HDMR expansion by support vector regression (SVR) for a function . In this paper the results for independent variables sampled over known probability distributions are reported. The theoretical foundation of the new approach relies on the kernel used in SVR itself being an HDMR expansion (referred to as the HDMR kernel ), i.e., an ANOVA kernel whose component kernels are mutually orthogonal and all non-constant component kernels have zero expectation. Several HDMR kernels are constructed as illustrations. While preserving the characteristic properties of HDMR, the svr-based HDMR method enables efficient construction of high dimensional models with satisfactory prediction accuracy from a modest number of samples, which also permits accurate computation of the sensitivity indices.

In order to improve the performance of the SVR model, a kernel function iteration scheme is introduced further. Due to the excellent generalization performance and structural risk minimization principle, the SVR possesses the advantages of solving non-linear prediction problems with small samples. Thus, the proposed method is capable of computing the Sobol' indices with a relatively limited number of model evaluations.

The high dimensional model representation (HDMR) method was developed to express the input-output relationships of a complex model with a high dimensional input space. HDMR provides a model replacement that can be easily employed within global SA. In this work an optimisation method is developed as an extension to the existing set of HDMR tools to improve the accuracy of the mapping process. An application from the field of urban flow and dispersion is chosen to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. Model replacements of a k-epsilon model simulating the flow field in an urban street canyon are constructed. The necessary computational effort for their construction is considerably lower than required by traditional global SA methods. First- and second-order sensitivity indices can then be calculated using the replacements without the need for additional full model runs. Comparison with a large sample of full model runs demonstrates that the output statistics of the full model are well represented by the model replacements. The proposed HDMR method therefore provides a powerful tool for general application to global SA of environmental models. (C) , Elsevier Ltd.

The input random fields of flow model are parameterized in a stochastic space for simulation. This often results in high stochastic dimensionality due to small correlation length of the covariance functions of the input fields. To efficiently treat the high-dimensional stochastic problem, we extend a recently proposed hybrid high-dimensional model representation (HDMR) technique to high-dimensional problems with multiple random input fields and integrate it with a sparse grid stochastic collocation method (SGSCM). Hybrid HDMR can decompose the high-dimensional model into a moderate M-dimensional model and a few one-dimensional models. The moderate dimensional model only depends on the most M important random dimensions, which are identified from the full stochastic space by sensitivity analysis. To extend the hybrid HDMR, we consider two different criteria for sensitivity test. Each of the derived low-dimensional stochastic models is solved by the SGSCM. This leads to a set of uncoupled deterministic problems at the collocation points, which can be solved by a deterministic solver. To demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method, a few numerical experiments are carried out for the unconfined flow problems in heterogeneous porous media with different correlation lengths. The results show that a good trade-off between computational complexity and approximation accuracy can be achieved for stochastic unconfined flow problems by selecting a suitable number of the most important dimensions in the M-dimensional model of hybrid HDMR.",,WOS:000399692500002,PARTIAL-DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS FINITE-ELEMENT-METHOD COLLOCATION METHOD DIMENSION REDUCTION POROUS-MEDIA REPRESENTATIONS CONVERGENCE,A stochastic model reduction method for nonlinear unconfined flow with multiple random input fields,2017

After several decades of development, sensitivity analysis of independent inputs has been developed very well, with that of correlated inputs receiving increasing attention in recent years. This paper introduces a new sensitivity analysis technique for model with correlated inputs. The new method allows us to quantitatively distinguish the effects of the correlated and uncorrelated variations of the model inputs on the uncertainty in model output. This is achieved by performing covariance decomposition for the uncertainty contribution of the inputs after decoupling the correlated and uncorrelated parts of the component functions in the high dimension model representation (HDMR) of the output.

It is an efficient formulation of the system response, if higher-order cooperative effects are weak, allowing the physical model to be captured by the lower-order terms. The paper's aim is to develop a new computational tool for estimating probabilistic sensitivity of structural/mechanical systems subject to random loads, material properties and geometry. Design/methodology/approach - When first-order HDMR approximation of the original high-dimensional limit state is not adequate to provide the desired accuracy to the sensitivity analysis, this paper presents an enhanced HDMR (eHDMR) method to represent the higher-order terms of HDMR expansion by expressions similar to the lower-Order ones with monomial multipliers. The accuracy of the HDMR expansion can be significantly improved using preconditioning with a minimal number of additional input-output samples without directly invoking the determination of second- and higher-order terms. As a part of this effort, the efficacy of HDMR, which is recently applied to uncertainty analysis, is also demonstrated. The method is based on computing eHDMR approximation of system responses and score functions associated with probability distribution of a random input. Surrogate model is constructed using moving least squares interpolation formula. Once the surrogate model form is defined, both the probabilistic response and its sensitivities can be estimated from a single probabilistic analysis, without requiring the gradients of performance functions. Findings - The results of two numerical examples involving mathematical function and structural/solid-mechanics problems indicate that the sensitivities obtained using eHDMR approximation provide significant accuracy when compared with the conventional Monte Carlo method, while requiring fewer original model simulations. Originality/value - This is the first time where application of eHDMR concepts is explored in the stochastic sensitivity analysis. The present computational approach is valuable to the practical modelling and design community.",,WOS:000286569400004,DIMENSIONAL MODEL REPRESENTATIONS STRUCTURAL RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS SYSTEMS UNCERTAINTY GRADIENT,Stochastic sensitivity analysis using preconditioning approach,2010

The analysis is used to investigate the important features of the oxidation process, as well as possible factors underlying qualitative discrepancies between simulations and experiments. The particular feature of interest is the characteristic of quadratic autocatalysis, which is observed experimentally and leads to the maximum rate of reaction occurring at % consumption of the deficient reactant (oxygen), with the fuel consumption exerting only a weak dependence. The kinetic mechanisms tested do not exhibit this characteristic when simulating the experimental conditions. The models also exhibit shorter induction times than those observed in the experiment. The HDMR study demonstrates a sensitivity of these features to the A-factors of key reactions of the cyclohexylperoxy radical (CHOO). At the low temperatures studied here, these are peroxy-peroxy radical reactions rather than the isomerisation routes that have been the subject of other investigations at higher temperatures. The low temperature product channels for reactions of the cyclohexylperoxy radical are therefore an important area for future kinetic studies. The effects of wall reactions of peroxy and peroxide species were not found to outweigh the impact of the main A-factors, but including wall losses led to significant higher order interactions between input parameters.

Then by analyzing the composition of these variance contributions, the variance contributions by an individual correlated input to the model output are further decomposed into independent contribution by the individual input itself, independent contribution by interaction between the individual input and the others, contribution purely by correlation between the individual input and the others, and contribution by interaction associated with correlation between the individual input and the others.

For example, after nitrate has been reduced, soluble U(VI) can be reduced simultaneously with other electron acceptors such as Fe(Ill) or sulfate to U(IV), which may precipitate as a solid (uraninite). To simulate the numerous biogeochemical processes that will occur during the bioremediation of trace-metal-contaminated aquifers, a time-dependent one-dimensional reactive transport model has been developed. The model consists of a set of coupled mass balance equations, accounting for advection, hydrodynamic dispersion, and a kinetic formulation of the biological or chemical transformations affecting an organic substrate, electron acceptors, corresponding reduced species, and trace metal contaminants of interest, uranium in this study. This set of equations is solved numerically, using a finite difference approximation. The redox conditions of the domain are characterized by estimating the pE, based on the concentration of the dominant terminal electron acceptor and its corresponding reduced species. This pE and the concentrations of relevant species are then used by a modified version of MINTEQA, which calculates the speciation/sorption and precipitation/dissolution of the species of interest under equilibrium conditions.

Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) approach is based on the variance based method incorporating Random Sampling-High Dimensional Model Representation (RS-HDMR) expansion in which component functions are determined by diffeomorphic modulation under observable response preserving homotopy (D-MORPH) regression. The advantage of the D-MORPH regression lies in its capability to solve linear algebraic equations with a limited number of sample points. The main purpose is to investigate the influence of fiber path, regarded as the design variable, on the formability and structural performance of FRCs. Wherein, spring-back and load-carrying capacity are two meaningful problems to be addressed. Two typical FRCs are included that an L-shaped part with straight fiber path using autoclave manufacturing process and a variable stiffness composite cylindrical shell under pure bending. The work not only focuses on the ranking of design variables but also hopes to find out their interactions represented by the second order global sensitivity indexes. After being tested by three typical numerical functions, the GSA algorithm highlights that spring-back of FRC using autoclave manufacturing process is most sensitive to fiber orientation angles on plies close to the tool. And buckling performance of the VS cylinder is dominated by fiber orientation angles at compression/tension regions.",,WOS:000406604700013,DIMENSIONAL MODEL REPRESENTATIONS PLATES UNCERTAINTY DESIGN OPTIMIZATION PARAMETERS REGRESSION,Global sensitivity analysis for fiber reinforced composite fiber path based on D-MORPH-HDMR algorithm,2017

The method is based on the cut-HDMR approach, which is here derived in a different way and new conclusions are presented. The cut-HDMR approach decomposes the stochastic space into sub-domains, which are separately interpolated via a selected interpolation technique. This leads to a dramatic reduction of necessary samples for high dimensional spaces and decreases the influence of the Curse of Dimensionality. The proposed non-intrusive method is based on the coupling of an interpolation technique with the cut-HDMR (high dimension model representation) approach. The new conclusions obtained from the new derivation of the cut-HDMR approach allow one to interpolate each stochastic domain separately, including all stochastic variables and interactions between variables. Moreover, the same conclusions allow one to neglect non-important stochastic domains and therefore, drastically reduce the number of samples to detect and interpolate the higher order interactions. A new sampling strategy is introduced, which is based on a tensor product, but it uses the idea of Smoylak sparse grid for higher domains. For this work, the multi-dimensional Lagrange interpolation technique is selected and is applied for all parts of the cut-HDMR approach. However, the nature of the method allows one to use a combination of various interpolation techniques. The sensitivity analysis is performed on the surrogate model using the Monte Carlo sampling. In this work, the Sobol's approach is followed and sensitivity indices are established for each variable and interaction. Moreover, due to the obtained conclusions, the separate surrogate models allow one to visualize the uncertainty in the high dimensional space via histograms. The usage of a histogram for each stochastic domain allows one to establish full statistical properties of a given stochastic domain. This helps the user to better understand the stochastic propagation for the model of interest. The proposed interpolation technique and sensitivity analysis approach are tested on a simple example and applied on the well-known Borehole problem. Results of the proposed method are compared to the Monte Carlo sampling using the mean value and the standard deviation. Results of the sensitivity analysis of the Borehole case are compared to the literature results and the statistical visualization of each variable is provided.",,WOS:000364104200001,IDENTIFY IMPORTANT FACTORS LARGE-SCALE SIMULATIONS STATISTICAL-ANALYSES POLYNOMIAL CHAOS SPARSE GRIDS SCATTERPLOTS,HIGH DIMENSIONAL SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS USING SURROGATE MODELING AND HIGH DIMENSIONAL MODEL REPRESENTATION,2015

In order to capture the small scale heterogeneity, a new mixed multiscale finite element method is developed within the framework of the heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM) in the spatial domain. This new method ensures both local and global mass conservation. Starting from a specified covariance function, the stochastic log-permeability is discretized in the stochastic space using a truncated Karhunen-Loeve expansion with several random variables. Due to the small correlation length of the covariance function, this often results in a high stochastic dimensionality. Therefore, a newly developed adaptive high dimensional stochastic model representation technique (HDMR) is used in the stochastic space. This results in a set of low stochastic dimensional subproblems which are efficiently solved using the adaptive sparse grid collocation method (ASGC).

This assessment considers improvement achieved with respect to conventional techniques of modeling uncertainty (Monte Carlo). Given that traditional methods for characterizing uncertainty are very computationally demanding, when they are applied in conjunction with complex environmental fate and transport models, this study aims to assess how accurately these efficient (and hence viable) techniques for uncertainty propagation can capture complex model output uncertainty. As a part of this effort, the efficacy of HDMR, which has primarily been used in the past as a model reduction tool, is also demonstrated for uncertainty analysis. The application chosen to highlight the accuracy of these new techniques is the steady state analysis of the groundwater flow in the Savannah River Site General Separations Area (GSA) using the subsurface Flow And Contaminant Transport (FACT) code. Uncertain inputs included three-dimensional hydraulic conductivity fields, and a two-dimensional recharge rate field. The output variables under consideration were the simulated stream baseflows and hydraulic head values.

The approach is based on the idea of High Dimensional Model Representation technique which utilize a reduced number of model runs to build an uncertainty propagation model that expresses the variability of optimal solution in the uncertain space. Based on this idea, a systematic procedure is developed where in the first step the possible changes in the optimal design configurations due to parametric uncertainty are identified. In the next step, the variability of optimal solution with parameter uncertainty for each design is captured. Having obtained a parametric expression of optimal objective for each design, the optimal solution can be determined by comparing the solutions for different designs. The proposed approach provides information about variation of the optimal objective and optimal design configuration over the entire uncertain space. This information can then be judiciously utilized in any decision making depending on specific process requirements. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that it does not depend on the nature or existence of a mathematical model to describe the input-output relationship of the process.", (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Extensions to the existing set of random sampling (RS)-HDMR tools have been developed in order to make the method more applicable for complex models with a large number of input parameters as often appear in environmental modelling. The HDMR software described here combines the RS-HDMR tools and its extensions in one Matlab package equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI). This makes the HDMR method easily available for all interested users. The performance of the GUI-HDMR software has been tested in this paper using two analytical test models, the Ishigami function and the Sobol' g-function. In both cases the model is highly non-linear, non-monotonic and has significant parameter interactions. The developed GUI-HDMR software copes very well with the test cases and sensitivity indices of first and second order could be calculated accurately with only low computational effort. The efficiency of the software has also been compared against other recently developed approaches and is shown to be competitive. GUI-HDMR can be applied to a wide range of applications in all fields, because in principle only one random or quasi-random set of input and output values is required to estimate all sensitivity indices up to second order. The size of the set of samples is however dependent on the problem and can be successively increased if additional accuracy is required. A brief description of its application within a range of modelling environments is given. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

Sensitivities to the model input parameters are explored for different source NOx scenarios. The wind tunnel experiments of Brown and Bilger () provide the simulation conditions for the first case study where photolysis reactions are not included and the main uncertainties occur in parameters defining the turbulence scales, source size and reaction rate of NO with O-. Using nominal values of the parameters from previous studies, the model gives a good representation of the radial profile of the conserved mean scalar (Gamma) over bar (NOx) although slightly over predicts peak mean NO concentrations (Gamma) over bar (NO) compared to the experiments. The high dimensional model representation (HDMR) method is used to investigate the effects of uncertainties in model inputs on the simulation of chemical species concentrations. For this scenario, the Lagrangian velocity structure function coefficient has the largest impact on simulated (Gamma) over bar (NOx) profiles. Photolysis reactions are then included in a chemical scheme consisting of eight reactions between species NO, O, O- and NO. Independent and interactive effects of  input parameters are studied for two source NOx scenarios using HDMR, including turbulence parameters, temperature dependant rate parameters, photolysis rates, temperature, fraction of NO in total NO, at the source and background ozone concentration [O-]. For this reactive case, the variance in the predicted mean plume centre (Gamma) over bar (O) is caused by parameters describing both physical (mixing time-scale coefficient) and chemical processes (activation energy for the reaction O-+NO). The variance in predicted plume centre (Gamma) over bar (NO) and root mean square NO concentration gamma(NO)'. is Strongly influenced by the fraction of NO in the source NOx, and to a lesser extent the mixing time-scale coefficient. Adjusting the latter gives improved agreement with the Brown and Bilger experiment. Some weak parameter interactions are observed. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

Parameters in a chemical mechanism have uncertainties, leading to the uncertainties of model predictions. A recently developed global sensitivity analysis (SA) method based on Random Sampling-High Dimensional Model Representation (RS-HDMR) was applied to the Regional Atmospheric Chemical Mechanism (RACM) within a zero-dimensional photochemical model to highlight the main uncertainty sources of atmospheric hydroxyl (OH) and hydroperoxyl (HO) radicals. This global SA approach can be applied as a routine in zero-dimensional photochemical modeling to comprehensively assess model uncertainty and sensitivity under different conditions. It also highlights the parameters to which the model is most sensitive during periods when the model/measurement OH and HO discrepancies are greatest. Uncertainties in  model parameters were assigned for measured constituents used to constrain the model, for photolysis and kinetic rate coefficients, and for product yields of the reactions. With simulations performed for the hourly field data of two typical days, modeled and measured OH and HO generally agree better for polluted conditions than for cleaner conditions, except during morning rush hour.
